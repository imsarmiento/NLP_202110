"Monica:"," There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
"
"Joey:"," C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!
"
"Chandler:"," All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
"
"Phoebe:"," Wait, does he eat chalk?
"
"Phoebe:"," Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!
"
"Monica:"," Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.
"
"Chandler:"," Sounds like a date to me.
"
"Chandler:"," Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.
"
"Chandler:"," Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.
"
"Joey:"," Instead of...?
"
"Chandler:"," That's right.
"
"Joey:"," Never had that dream.
"
"Phoebe:"," No.
"
"Chandler:"," All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.
"
"Monica:"," And they weren't looking at you before?!
"
"Chandler:"," Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!
"
"Ross:"," (mortified) Hi.
"
"Joey:"," This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.
"
"Monica:"," Are you okay, sweetie?
"
"Ross:"," I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...
"
"Chandler:"," Cookie?
"
"Monica:"," (explaining to the others) Carol moved her stuff out today.
"
"Joey:"," Ohh.
"
"Monica:"," (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.
"
"Ross:"," Thanks.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air just in front of Ross.)
"
"Ross:"," No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?
"
"Phoebe:"," Fine!  Be murky!
"
"Ross:"," I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.
"
"Monica:"," No you don't.
"
"Ross:"," No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!
"
"Joey:"," And you never knew she was a lesbian...
"
"Ross:"," No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?
"
"Chandler:"," Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They all stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?
"
"Ross:"," I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.
"
"Monica:"," Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., ""I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren."" was what?  A wrong number?
"
"Ross:"," Sorry.
"
"Joey:"," Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?
"
"Joey:"," Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!
"
"Ross:"," I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!
"
"Chandler:"," And I just want a million dollars! (He extends his hand hopefully.)
"
"Monica:"," Rachel?!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!
"
"Monica:"," (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?
"
"Rachel:"," Hi, sure!
"
"Ross:"," Hi.
"
"Monica:"," So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.
"
"Monica:"," Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
"
"Rachel:"," Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue... [Scene: Monica's Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV and are trying to figure out what is going on.]
"
"Monica:"," Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.
"
"Chandler:"," (imitating the characters) Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!
"
"Ross:"," (in a deep voice) I'll have whatever Christine is having.
"
"Rachel:"," (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!
"
"Phoebe:","  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.
"
"Chandler:"," (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.
"
"Joey:"," I say push her down the stairs.
"
"Rachel:"," C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!
"
"Ross:"," You can see where he'd have trouble.
"
"Rachel:"," Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.
"
"Monica:"," Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...
"
"Rachel:"," Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!
"
"Monica:"," Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...
"
"Phoebe:"," (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...
"
"Rachel:"," I'm all better now.
"
"Phoebe:"," (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to Chandler and Joey.) I helped!
"
"Monica:"," Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.
"
"Joey:"," (comforting her) And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.
"
"Monica:"," Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!
"
"Joey:"," What, like there's a rule or something?
"
"Chandler:"," Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.
"
"Monica:"," Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!
"
"Joey:"," Who's Paul?
"
"Ross:"," Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?
"
"Monica:"," Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
"
"Ross:"," He finally asked you out?
"
"Monica:"," Yes!
"
"Chandler:"," Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.
"
"Monica:"," Rach, wait, I can cancel...
"
"Rachel:"," Please, no, go, that'd be fine!
"
"Monica:"," (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?
"
"Ross:"," (choked voice) That'd be good...
"
"Monica:"," (horrified) Really?
"
"Ross:"," (normal voice) No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!
"
"Phoebe:"," What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn't know.)
"
"Monica:"," Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all lined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.
"
"Chandler:"," I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?
"
"Monica:"," Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...
"
"Ross:"," A wandering?
"
"Monica:"," Change!  Okay, sit down. (Shows Paul in) Two seconds.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.
"
"Joey:","  Hey, Paul!
"
"Joey:"," Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.
"
"Monica:"," (yelling from the bedroom) Shut up, Joey!
"
"Ross:"," So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?
"
"Rachel:"," Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!
"
"Ross:"," Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.
"
"Chandler:"," (deadpan) Yes, and we're very excited about it.
"
"Rachel:"," Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, sure.
"
"Joey:"," Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.
"
"Phoebe:"," (singing) Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.  La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some change and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!
"
"Ross:"," (squatting and reading the instructions) I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.
"
"Joey:"," I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.
"
"Chandler:"," It's a beautiful thing.
"
"Joey:"," (picking up a leftover part) What's this?
"
"Chandler:"," I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.
"
"Joey:"," Which goes where?
"
"Chandler:"," I have no idea.
"
"Joey:"," Done with the bookcase!
"
"Chandler:"," All finished!
"
"Ross:"," (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.
"
"Joey:"," Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.
"
"Joey:"," Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?
"
"Ross:"," You guys.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, God.
"
"Joey:"," You got screwed.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh my God!
"
"Monica:"," Oh my God!
"
"Monica:"," My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?
"
"Monica:"," -leg?
"
"Monica:"," You actually broke her watch?  Wow!  The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel.
"
"Monica:"," That's right. [Scene: Monica's Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]
"
"Rachel:"," Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju- (She stops talking and dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it isn't me, it's not me.  And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)
"
"Ross:"," I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!
"
"Joey:"," Shut up!
"
"Chandler:"," You must stop! (Chandler hits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)
"
"Ross:"," That only took me an hour.
"
"Chandler:"," Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!
"
"Ross:"," You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...
"
"Joey:"," What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!
"
"Ross:"," I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
"
"Chandler:"," Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]
"
"Monica:"," What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?
"
"Monica:"," Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?
"
"Monica:"," (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...
"
"Monica:"," I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
"
"Monica:"," Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!
"
"Monica:"," (pause)...Yeah. Yeah, I do.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!
"
"Ross:"," (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?
"
"Joey:"," Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man, (looks to Chandler)
"
"Chandler:"," Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.
"
"Joey:"," Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here. (Exits.)
"
"Ross:"," Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? (He gazes out of the window.)
"
"Rachel:"," Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life.
"
"Chandler:"," That is amazing.
"
"Joey:"," Congratulations.
"
"Rachel:"," Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there isn't anything I can't do.
"
"Chandler:"," If can invade Poland, there isn't anything I can't do.
"
"Joey:"," Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelet or something... (Joey and Chandler taste the coffee, grimace, and pour it into a plant pot.) Although actually I'm really not that hungry...
"
"Monica:"," (entering, to herself) Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here.
"
"Joey:"," Morning, Paul.
"
"Rachel:"," Hello, Paul.
"
"Chandler:"," Hi, Paul, is it?
"
"Monica:"," Stop!
"
"Monica:"," We'll talk later.
"
"Joey:"," That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
"
"Monica:"," Shut up, and put my table back.
"
"Chandler:"," All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference...
"
"Rachel:"," So, like, you guys all have jobs?
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, I'm an actor.
"
"Rachel:"," Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
"
"Joey:"," I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
"
"Monica:"," Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.
"
"Joey:"," Look, it was a job all right?
"
"Chandler:"," 'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'
"
"Joey:"," I will not take this abuse. (Walks to the door and opens it to leave.)
"
"Chandler:"," You're right, I'm sorry. (Burst into song and dances out of the door.) ""Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy...""
"
"Joey:"," You should both know, that he's a dead man.  Oh, Chandler? (Starts after Chandler.)
"
"Monica:"," So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
"
"Rachel:"," I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
"
"Monica:"," I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, yeah.
"
"Monica:"," Well, it's like that. With feelings.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
"
"Monica:"," Big time!
"
"Rachel:"," Want a wedding dress?   Hardly used.
"
"Monica:"," I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, look, wish me luck!
"
"Monica:"," What for?
"
"Rachel:"," I'm gonna go get one of those (Thinks) job things.
"
"Monica:"," Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida?
"
"Monica:"," How do you do that?
"
"Monica:"," You know Paul?
"
"Monica:"," You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
"
"Joey:"," (sitting on the arm of the couch)Of course it was a line!
"
"Monica:"," Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?
"
"Ross:"," I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
"
"Monica:"," I hate men!  I hate men!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.
"
"Monica:"," Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
"
"Phoebe:"," All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. (She starts massaging them.)
"
"Monica:"," I just thought he was nice, y'know?
"
"Joey:"," (bursts out laughing again) I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
"
"Rachel:"," Guess what?
"
"Ross:"," You got a job?
"
"Rachel:"," Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
"
"Chandler:"," And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
"
"Rachel:"," You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, how well you know me...
"
"Rachel:"," They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!
"
"Monica:"," How'd you pay for them?
"
"Rachel:"," Uh, credit card.
"
"Monica:"," And who pays for that?
"
"Rachel:"," Um... my... father.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.
"
"Monica:"," C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.
"
"Rachel:"," I know that. That's why I was getting married.
"
"Phoebe:"," Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.
"
"Rachel:"," Thank you.
"
"Phoebe:"," You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.
"
"Ross:"," The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
"
"Monica:"," All right, you ready?
"
"Rachel:"," No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  ""Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?""  Come on, I can't do this!
"
"Monica:"," You can, I know you can!
"
"Rachel:"," I don't think so.
"
"Ross:"," Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from that morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)
"
"Ross:"," C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
"
"Rachel:"," Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
"
"Monica:","  Rachel!  That was a library card!
"
"Chandler:"," (as Rachel is cutting up her cards) Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
"
"Monica:"," Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
"
"Monica:"," Well, that's it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch?
"
"Ross:"," No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
"
"Monica:"," You be okay?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What?
"
"Monica:"," That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
"
"Ross:"," Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no-
"
"Rachel:"," Sorry-
"
"Ross:"," No no no, go-
"
"Rachel:"," No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
"
"Ross:"," Split it?
"
"Rachel:"," Okay.
"
"Ross:"," Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.
"
"Rachel:"," I knew.
"
"Ross:"," You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
"
"Rachel:"," I did.
"
"Ross:"," Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, maybe...
"
"Ross:"," Okay... okay, maybe I will...
"
"Rachel:"," Goodnight.
"
"Ross:"," Goodnight.
"
"Monica:"," See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?
"
"Ross:"," I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that means.)
"
"Joey:"," I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
"
"Phoebe:"," (sings) I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
"
"Monica:"," What? I-I said you had a-
"
"Phoebe:"," (sings) What I said you had...
"
"Monica:"," (to Phoebe) Would you stop?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, was I doing it again?
"
"Monica:"," I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
"
"Ross:"," There's an image.
"
"Rachel:"," (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee?
"
"Chandler:"," Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
"
"Rachel:"," I'm just serving it.
"
"Chandler:"," Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. (Rachel sits down to hear Chandler's dream.)
"
"Rachel:"," Ugh. (To another customer that's leaving.) Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank you. (To the gang.) Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-
"
"Monica:"," What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, yeah!
"
"Rachel:"," Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
"
"Monica:"," Absolutely.
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.
"
"Chandler:"," The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.
"
"Joey:"," (pause)....Are we still talking about sex?
"
"Ross:"," No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?
"
"Ross:"," Does she.
"
"Ross:"," Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?
"
"Ross:"," (trying to ignore her) No. No.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, okay, yes, it is. (waves) How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.
"
"Ross:","Hi.
"
"Ross:"," You look great. I, uh... I hate that.
"
"Ross:"," Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...
"
"Ross:"," Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?
"
"Ross:"," Why- why are you here, Carol?
"
"Ross:"," Pregnant?!
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.
"
"Phoebe:","...Then I've already seen this one! (Turns off the TV.)
"
"Monica:"," (taking a drink from Joey) Are you through with that?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.
"
"Monica:"," Whose little ball of paper is this?!
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and... (sees that Monica is glaring at him) ...now I wish I was dead.
"
"Phoebe:"," She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that- (Monica glares at her.) -but, it's fine!
"
"Monica:"," Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.
"
"Phoebe:"," Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.
"
"Monica:"," That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.
"
"Chandler:"," (looking out the window) Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!
"
"Monica:"," What?
"
"Chandler:"," Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
"
"Rachel:"," Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, it's beautiful.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... (Starts to look under the couch cushions.)
"
"Phoebe:"," No, look, don't touch that!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...
"
"Monica:"," Easy Rach, we'll find it. (To all) Won't we!
"
"Joey:"," Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?
"
"Phoebe:"," Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
"
"Chandler:"," You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
"
"Rachel:"," I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...
"
"Chandler:"," ...Dinah?
"
"Rachel:"," (looks at the lasagne and realizes something) Ohhhhh, don't be mad...
"
"Monica:"," You didn't.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, I am sorry...
"
"Monica:"," I gave you one job! (Starts to examin the lasagne through the bottom of the glass pan.)
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!
"
"Chandler:"," Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...
"
"Monica:"," (puts down the lasagne) I just... can't do it.
"
"Chandler:"," Boys? We're going in.
"
"Ross:"," (standing outside the door).....Hi.
"
"Monica:"," Wow. That is not a happy hi.
"
"Ross:"," Carol's pregnant.
"
"Phoebe:"," (while everyone else is stunned) Ooh! I found it!
"
"Monica:"," W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
"
"Ross:"," Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. (He enters.)
"
"Chandler:"," Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?
"
"Rachel:"," Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?
"
"Ross:"," Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.
"
"Phoebe:"," She is so great! I miss her.
"
"Monica:"," What does she mean by 'involved'?
"
"Chandler:"," I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.
"
"Ross:"," Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.
"
"Rachel:"," So what are you gonna do?
"
"Ross:"," I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.
"
"Joey:"," .....Well, this is still ruined, right?
"
"Monica:"," Curry.
"
"Ross:"," I- I think they're great! I, I really do.
"
"Ross:"," Aw, Mom...
"
"Monica:"," I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?
"
"Monica:"," No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.
"
"Monica:"," Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah. (They go to the kitchen.)
"
"Monica:"," I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.
"
"Monica:"," What's that supposed to mean?
"
"Monica:"," No it's not.
"
"Monica:"," (trying desperately to change the subject) So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? (Digs her elbow into his hand.) No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
"
"Ross:"," (pulls his hand away) Okay! Okay. (To his parents) Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.
"
"Joey:"," Your folks are really that bad, huh?
"
"Ross:"," Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.
"
"Monica:"," Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could- (To Ross) -I'd want yours.
"
"Ross:"," Must pee. (Goes to pee.)
"
"Phoebe:"," Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
"
"Rachel:"," You're twins?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.
"
"Chandler:"," What does she do?
"
"Phoebe:"," She's a waitress.
"
"Rachel:"," All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. (They all start to leave.)
"
"Monica:"," Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.
"
"Rachel:"," The lights, please..
"
"Ross:"," ...How long was I in there?
"
"Rachel:"," I'm just cleaning up.
"
"Ross:"," D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
"
"Rachel:"," Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! (She hands him the broom and sits down.)
"
"Ross:"," Anyway.. um.. (Starts to sweep.) So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh.. a little..
"
"Ross:"," Mm-hmm..
"
"Rachel:"," A lot.
"
"Ross:"," Mm.
"
"Rachel:"," So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?
"
"Ross:"," Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?
"
"Ross:"," Got me.
"
"Rachel:"," Remember when we were in high school together?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah.
"
"Rachel:"," I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it? (Ross gazes at her.) ..Ross?
"
"Ross:"," Yes, yes!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. (She leans back onto his hand.)
"
"Ross:"," Me either... (He pulls up a stool so that he doesn't have to move his hand.)
"
"Ross:"," (entering) Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.
"
"Ross:"," How could I forget?
"
"Ross:"," (they shake hands) Hello, Susan. (To Carol) Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?
"
"Ross:"," ..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
"
"Ross:"," -she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?
"
"Ross:"," Okay, that's great. (Susan gives her drink to Carol.) No, I'm- Oh. 
"
"Ross:"," (picks up a surgical instrament and mimes a duck with it) Quack, quack..
"
"Rachel:"," Barry?
"
"Rachel:"," (hesitates) Are you sure?
"
"Rachel:"," I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great!
"
"Rachel:"," I dumped him.
"
"Ross:"," So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?
"
"Ross:"," Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?
"
"Ross:"," Marlon?!
"
"Ross:"," ...As in Mouse?
"
"Ross:"," Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?
"
"Ross:"," 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, not much. I-I got a job.
"
"Rachel:"," Why are- why are you so tanned?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
"
"Rachel:"," Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh! Well, um.. (Grabs his forehand) You've got plugs!
"
"Rachel:"," And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
"
"Rachel:"," Okay..
"
"Rachel:"," Wow.
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Rachel:"," Anyway, um, (Gets the ring out of her purse.) I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me.
"
"Ross:"," Helen Geller? I don't think so.
"
"Ross:"," Thank you!
"
"Ross:"," What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?
"
"Ross:"," Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.
"
"Ross:"," No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.
"
"Ross:"," Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.
"
"Ross:"," My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-
"
"Ross:"," You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.
"
"Ross:"," Oh my God.
"
"Ross:"," Well? Isn't that amazing?
"
"Joey:"," What are we supposed to be seeing here?
"
"Chandler:"," I dunno, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise.
"
"Phoebe:"," You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato.
"
"Ross:"," Then don't do that, alright?
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay!
"
"Ross:"," (walks over to where Monica is standing)Monica. Whaddya think?
"
"Monica:"," (welling up) Mm-hmm.
"
"Ross:"," Wh- are you welling up?
"
"Monica:"," No.
"
"Ross:"," You are, you're welling up.
"
"Monica:"," Am not!
"
"Ross:"," You're gonna be an aunt.
"
"Monica:"," (pushes him and starts to cry) Oh shut up!
"
"Rachel:"," (on phone) Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. (Slams the phone down.) (To everyone) Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now.
"
"Phoebe:"," (entering) Hi guys!
"
"Ross:"," Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go?
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'
"
"Rachel:"," What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?
"
"Monica:"," Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'.
"
"Rachel:"," Since when?
"
"Joey:"," Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'.
"
"Chandler:"," Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'.
"
"Phoebe:"," Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'.
"
"Rachel:"," And everybody knows this?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah. Cushions the blow.
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm.
"
"Ross:"," That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
"
"Monica:"," Uh, Ross.
"
"Ross:"," What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!
"
"Chandler:"," ""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?""
"
"Joey:"," ""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die.""
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, that was really good!
"
"Joey:"," Thanks! Let's keep going.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?""
"
"Joey:"," ""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke.""
"
"Chandler:"," ""Smoke away.""
"
"Chandler:"," I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Chandler:"," Relax your hand!
"
"Chandler:"," Not so much!
"
"Joey:"," Whoah!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey!
"
"Joey:"," Hey!
"
"Chandler:"," Alright, now try taking a puff.
"
"Chandler:"," Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
"
"Joey:"," No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette.
"
"Chandler:"," It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here.
"
"Chandler:"," Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete.
"
"Joey:"," Y'miss it?
"
"Chandler:"," Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. (Takes a puff.) Oh.. my.. God. (He continues to smoke.)
"
"Monica:"," No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger.
"
"Joey:"," That's ridiculous!
"
"Ross:"," Can I use.. either thumb?
"
"Rachel:"," (carrying a tray of drinks) Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me! (Starts handing them out.) Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!
"
"Rachel:"," (leaving to serve others) Good for me!
"
"Joey:"," Y'okay, Phoebe?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank.
"
"Monica:"," What did they do to you?
"
"Phoebe:"," It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-
"
"Ross:"," Easy.
"
"Phoebe:"," - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, Satan's minions at work again...
"
"Phoebe:"," Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them.
"
"Joey:"," What are you talking about? Keep it!
"
"Phoebe:"," It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'...
"
"Monica:"," We're with you. We got it.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
"
"Rachel:"," Chandler, what are you doing?
"
"Monica:"," (puling him up) Hey. Whaddya doing?
"
"Ross:"," What is this?!
"
"Chandler:"," I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!
"
"Chandler:"," And this- is my reward!
"
"Ross:"," Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay, so this time I won't quit!
"
"Chandler:"," All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. (He drops it in Phoebe's coffee.)
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!
"
"Monica:"," Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date.
"
"Rachel:"," This Alan again? How's it goin'?
"
"Monica:"," 'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun.
"
"Joey:"," So when do we get to meet the guy?
"
"Monica:"," Let's see, today's Monday... Never.
"
"Monica:"," No. Not after what happened with Steve.
"
"Chandler:"," What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
"
"Monica:"," Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, then can we meet him?
"
"Monica:"," Nope. Schhorry.
"
"Monica:"," I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd.
"
"Monica:"," I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked.
"
"Joey:"," Let it go, Ross.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi.
"
"Monica:"," Do you all promise?
"
"Monica:"," (shouts to Chandler) Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
"
"Joey:"," You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!
"
"Ross:"," Hey, Pheebs.
"
"Phoebe:"," 'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this- (Searches in her purse) -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone!
"
"Rachel:"," What bank is this?
"
"Monica:"," Hey. It's him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
"
"Joey:"," (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He's here!
"
"Monica:"," (to all) Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me.
"
"Monica:"," Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan.
"
"Monica:"," (to Alan) Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. (Alan exits, to all) Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first shot, hmm?
"
"Monica:"," C'mon!
"
"Ross:"," ...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him.
"
"Monica:"," Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
"
"Rachel:"," And did you notice...? (She spreads her thumb and index finger.)
"
"Joey:"," Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!
"
"Ross:"," ...What shoe?
"
"Phoebe:"," From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'
"
"Ross:"," ...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
"
"Rachel:"," What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it.
"
"Monica:"," Really!
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? (Does the impression)
"
"Ross:"," You know what I like most about him, though?
"
"Ross:"," The way he makes me feel about myself.
"
"Monica:"," Hi.. how was the game?
"
"Ross:"," Well..
"
"Monica:"," Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
"
"Joey:"," Alan.
"
"Ross:"," He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-...
"
"Rachel:"," I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team.
"
"Chandler:"," Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball..
"
"Monica:"," Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
"
"Ross:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," ..I dunno, a little too Alan?
"
"Rachel:"," Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore.
"
"Chandler:"," I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey, Lizzie.
"
"Phoebe:"," I brought you alphabet soup.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you. (She searches in her purse.)
"
"Phoebe:"," No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?
"
"Phoebe:"," I know.
"
"Phoebe:"," No, I want you to have it. I don't want it.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, that's fine, no.
"
"Phoebe:"," No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay.
"
"Phoebe:"," No, I'm fine.
"
"Phoebe:"," Huh!
"
"Ross:"," A thumb?!
"
"Phoebe:"," I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!
"
"Chandler:"," Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?
"
"Phoebe:"," Does, um, anyone wanna see?
"
"Rachel:"," It's worse than the thumb!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, this is so unfair!
"
"Monica:"," Oh, why is it unfair?
"
"Chandler:"," So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?
"
"Joey:"," ...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
"
"Rachel:"," Well, I-I could live without it.
"
"Joey:"," Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, (Imitating Ross) ""you do, do you""?
"
"Ross:"," You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly.
"
"Rachel:"," ""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered.
"
"Rachel:"," Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on.
"
"Monica:"," Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
"
"Monica:"," Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like.
"
"Monica:"," Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing.
"
"Monica:"," I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
"
"Monica:"," No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about.
"
"Joey:"," Do you have any respect for your body?
"
"Ross:"," Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it.
"
"Rachel:"," (holding the phone out to Chandler) Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you.
"
"Chandler:"," Really? He does? (taking the phone) Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! (He hands the phone back and stubs out his cigarette.)
"
"Rachel:"," (to Ross, who has wandered up) God, he's good.
"
"Ross:"," If only he were a woman.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah.
"
"Chandler:"," Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too.
"
"Ross:"," Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. (Does so.)
"
"Monica:"," (entering) Hey. Where's Joey?
"
"Chandler:"," Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong?
"
"Rachel:"," I think he's across the hall.
"
"Monica:"," Thanks. (Goes to fetch him.)
"
"Ross:"," (finishing changing Chandler's nicotine patch) There y'go.
"
"Chandler:"," (deadpan) Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now.
"
"Ross:"," Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?
"
"Phoebe:"," Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
"
"Ross:"," Hey, I might!
"
"Phoebe:"," Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb.
"
"Phoebe:"," And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!
"
"Joey:"," (dragged in by Monica, he has just gotten out of the shower) What's going on?
"
"Monica:"," Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
"
"Joey:"," Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
"
"Rachel:"," Uh, Joey..
"
"Joey:"," Oh, God! (Hurriedly closes his legs.)
"
"Monica:"," (turns off the TV) Okay..
"
"Monica:"," Please, guys, we have to talk.
"
"Phoebe:"," Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not.
"
"Monica:"," Alright, we have to talk.
"
"Phoebe:"," There it is!
"
"Monica:"," Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan.
"
"Ross:"," Is there somebody else?
"
"Monica:"," No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change.
"
"Rachel:"," We didn't change..
"
"Joey:"," So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
"
"Phoebe:"," You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- (starts chewing her hair)
"
"Monica:"," Look, I- I could go on pretending-
"
"Joey:"," Okay!
"
"Monica:"," -but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!
"
"Ross:"," Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were.
"
"Monica:"," I'm sorry..
"
"Chandler:"," (sarcastic) Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!
"
"Rachel:"," (tearful) I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-
"
"Monica:"," I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
"
"Monica:"," Are you guys gonna be okay?
"
"Ross:"," Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time.
"
"Monica:"," (dubious) I understand.
"
"Monica:"," I'm, I'm really sorry.
"
"Monica:"," Relieved?
"
"Rachel:"," Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah. He could row like a viking.
"
"Monica:"," (entering) Hi.
"
"Ross:"," So how'd it go?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, y'know..
"
"Phoebe:"," Did he mention us?
"
"Monica:"," He said he's really gonna miss you guys. (dubious look)
"
"Ross:"," You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. (She sits down and Ross strokes her forehead.)
"
"Chandler:"," ...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
"
"Chandler:"," (leaving) I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!
"
"Phoebe:"," (shouting as he leaves) If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
"
"Chandler:"," (returns) Yeah, alright.
"
"Monica:"," Alright. Phoebe?
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?
"
"Chandler:"," Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever.
"
"Rachel:"," See, there's always one guy. (Mocking) ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."" (Joey enters.)
"
"Monica:"," Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?
"
"Joey:"," Probably kill myself!
"
"Monica:"," ..Excuse me?
"
"Joey:"," Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!
"
"Ross:"," Joey, uh- OMnipotent.
"
"Joey:"," You are? Ross, I'm sorry..
"
"Monica:"," How does she do that?
"
"Ross:"," I cannot sleep in a public place.
"
"Monica:"," Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
"
"Phoebe:"," (waking and startling them) Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
"
"Ross:"," It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again.
"
"Monica:"," What's going on with you?
"
"Phoebe:"," I got no sleep last night!
"
"Ross:"," Why?
"
"Phoebe:"," My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!
"
"Monica:"," Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
"
"Phoebe:"," Thanks.
"
"Joey:"," ...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here.
"
"Chandler:"," You got waaaay too much free time.
"
"Joey:"," (to Ross) Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you.
"
"Chandler:"," Happy birthday, pal!
"
"Joey:"," We love you, man. (Kisses Ross)
"
"Ross:"," Funny, my birthday was seven months ago.
"
"Joey:"," So?
"
"Ross:"," So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty.""
"
"Ross:"," Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
"
"Ross:"," Ohhh.
"
"Joey:"," What's wrong with the twentieth?
"
"Chandler:"," Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone?
"
"Ross:"," Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. (Joey is puzzled.) Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.
"
"Joey:"," The hell with hockey, let's all do that!
"
"Chandler:"," (trying to stop Ross leaving) C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, (Pretending to punch him in the stomach.) Huh? Huh? Huh?
"
"Ross:"," What are you doing?
"
"Chandler:"," (stops) I have no idea.
"
"Joey:"," C'mon, Ross!
"
"Ross:"," Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?
"
"Chandler:"," You got it.
"
"Rachel:"," Look-look-look-look-look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me!
"
"Phoebe:"," I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed.
"
"Monica:"," Wow, you worked in a mine?
"
"Phoebe:"," I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?
"
"Rachel:"," God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally(opens envelope)not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that.
"
"Chandler:"," (looking) Oh, this is not that bad.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.
"
"Ross:"," You can totally, totally live on this.
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, yeah.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, by the way, great service tonight.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh my God! (Rachel, Leslie, Kiki, and Joanne all scream and hug each other.
"
"Monica:"," (to Phoebe) I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
"
"Rachel:"," What are you guys doing here?
"
"Rachel:"," (to a pregnant Leslie) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!
"
"Rachel:"," (to Joanne) So what's going on with you?
"
"Phoebe:"," (to Monica) Look, look, I have elbows! (They scream.)
"
"Chandler:"," ...Poulet passes it up to Leetch! (Passes it to Joey.)
"
"Joey:"," Leetch spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! (He kicks it to Ross, but Ross is staring into a shop window.)
"
"Chandler:"," We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
"
"Ross:"," Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we- (off Chandler's look) Sorry. Sorry.
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Ross:"," Peach pit.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, Bunny?
"
"Ross:"," (points) Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-
"
"Joey:"," -Peaches?
"
"Ross:"," Actually, nectarines, but basically...
"
"Chandler:"," (to Joey) Could've been a peach.
"
"Ross:"," Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the- (looks up, realises, and points) -the bus stop... I'm fine.
"
"Joey:"," Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! (They turn to stare at him.) What? Thought we were trying to find stuff.
"
"Rachel:"," So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!
"
"Rachel:"," Okay.
"
"Rachel:"," What? Guys, I'm not.
"
"Rachel:"," I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.
"
"Monica:"," Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends? (She and Phoebe scream.) Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? (She pours the contents of the blender into some glasses.)
"
"Rachel:"," What's that?
"
"Monica:"," Weeeell, it's rum, and-
"
"Rachel:"," Okay. (Grabs the blender and starts to drink.)
"
"Monica:"," We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... (The phone rings and Monica answers it.)
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!
"
"Monica:"," Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, God, ask them what they want.
"
"Monica:"," (on phone) Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? (Listens) Yes, hold on. (To Rachel) Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account.
"
"Rachel:"," But I haven't used my card in weeks!
"
"Monica:"," That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay.
"
"Rachel:"," They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?
"
"Monica:"," (pauses then on the phone) Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?
"
"Rachel:"," Alright, c'mon! (Miserably) Let's play Twister!
"
"Ross:"," (squeezing past people) Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh.
"
"Chandler:"," What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
"
"Ross:"," No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost...
"
"Joey:"," C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit.
"
"Monica:"," You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
"
"Rachel:"," Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?
"
"Phoebe:"," You are just like Jack.
"
"Rachel:"," ...Jack from downstairs?
"
"Phoebe:"," No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
"
"Monica:"," Ah, the other Jack.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village..
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
"
"Rachel:"," But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like...
"
"Phoebe:"," Floopy?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah.
"
"Monica:"," So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, like that's a word.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together?
"
"Monica:"," ...Pheebs?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?
"
"Ross:"," Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!
"
"Chandler:"," (to Ross) See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks.
"
"Ross:"," Pass it! Pass it!
"
"Chandler:"," He's open!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!
"
"Chandler:"," (to the receptionist)'Scuse me.
"
"Chandler:"," Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. (The receptionist glares at him.)
"
"Ross:"," (jumping to his feet) Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented.
"
"Joey:"," Well, how long do you think it'll be?
"
"Ross:"," Hey, this- (she gives him a look and the guys back off) Heyy...
"
"Rachel:"," I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down.
"
"Monica:"," No, you were right. I don't have a plan. (There's a knock on the door.)
"
"Rachel:"," Thank God. Food. (She goes to answer the door.)
"
"Monica:"," Phoebe?
"
"Phoebe:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," Do you have a plan?
"
"Phoebe:"," I don't even have a 'pl'.
"
"Rachel:"," (miserably) No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese.
"
"Monica:"," (leaping off of the couch and runs up) Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos?'
"
"Monica:"," Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?
"
"Monica:"," Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
"
"Phoebe:"," And-and a power tie?
"
"Monica:"," (staggered) Oh God.
"
"Monica:"," Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! (Rachel pays him, Monica grabs some binoculars, and runs to the window.)
"
"Rachel:"," Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?
"
"Phoebe:"," Big Bird's friend.
"
"Monica:"," I see pizza!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see! (She runs up and takes the binoculars.)
"
"Rachel:"," Hello? Who are we spying on?
"
"Monica:"," White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman.
"
"Monica:"," Please tell me it's his mother.
"
"Phoebe:"," Definitely not his mother.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, no...
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza- (Yelling) Hey, that's not for you, bitch! (Phoebe covers her mouth with her hand walks away from the window.)
"
"Chandler:"," Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? (She slides the gladd panel over and Chandler talks through it in a loud voice.) Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other. (To the waiting room.) Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. (She slides the panel back, he turns, and it takes him by surprise.) Ba-!
"
"Monica:"," Light still out?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah.
"
"Monica:"," Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh please, they're having sex.
"
"Rachel:"," So, whaddya think George is like?
"
"Monica:"," I think he's shy.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah?
"
"Monica:"," Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
"
"Ross:"," I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?
"
"Joey:"," He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that.
"
"Ross:"," Look, it's just a little more complicated...
"
"Chandler:"," Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?
"
"Ross:"," Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you...
"
"Chandler:"," Then what?
"
"Ross:"," My first time with Carol was... (He mumbles the last part)
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Ross:"," It was my first time.
"
"Joey:"," With Carol? (Ross gives him a look.) Oh.
"
"Chandler:"," So in your whole life, you've only been with one(He gets a look too)oh.
"
"Joey:"," Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!
"
"Monica:"," Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?
"
"Phoebe:"," Uh-huh.
"
"Monica:"," Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley.
"
"Monica:"," What?! You slept with Jason?
"
"Phoebe:"," You'd already broken up.
"
"Rachel:"," How long?
"
"Phoebe:"," A couple hours.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, that's nice!
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, okay, okay, I got one! (She sits up and the cushion she was leaning against falls off of the balcony.) Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me.
"
"Monica:"," Excuse me?!
"
"Rachel:"," Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one? (To Phoebe) She was a big girl.
"
"Monica:"," Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!
"
"Rachel:"," I was laughing! You made me laugh! (Monica and Rachel start to squabble)
"
"Phoebe:"," There he is! There he is!
"
"Monica:"," Where?
"
"Phoebe:"," Right- where we've been looking all night!
"
"Rachel:"," He is so cute!
"
"Monica:"," Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!
"
"Joey:"," Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
"
"Chandler:"," I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic...
"
"Joey:"," Really?
"
"Chandler:"," No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. (Ross enters off camera)
"
"Ross:"," Hi. (He is wearing a piece of steel bandaged to his nose.  He tosses some forms onto reception desk.)
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight.
"
"Ross:"," Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?
"
"Joey:"," Oh, ah- the kid has it.
"
"Ross:"," The kid...? (To the kid) Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck.
"
"Chandler:"," You gotta do it, man.
"
"Ross:"," (to the kid) Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever(to Chandler)can't do it. (to the kid) Listen, uh- gimme back my puck.
"
"Ross:"," 'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!
"
"Ross:"," (tries to snatch it from the kid) GIVE ME MY PUCK!! (but it files out of his grasp and knocks out the receptionist)
"
"Ross:"," ...Now that was fun.
"
"Ross:"," (Doing the spinning) Okay, Monica: Right foot red.
"
"Monica:"," Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo.
"
"Chandler:"," Thanks. (The guy nods and leaves)
"
"Ross:"," Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. (Phoebe has to bend over.)Good. (Joey stares at her butt appreciatively)
"
"Chandler:"," Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, okay. Will you take my place?
"
"Chandler:"," Alright. (on phone) Yes, this is Rachel.
"
"Rachel:"," Nooo! (She grabs the phone and Chandler takes her place on the mat.) (On phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. (Listens) Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really.
"
"Ross:"," Green. To the green.
"
"Rachel:"," (on phone) I've got magic beans. (Listens) Never-never mind.
"
"Chandler:"," To the left, to the left- aww! (They all collapse)
"
"Rachel:"," (on phone) Ohhh... I'm fine.
"
"Monica:"," Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
"
"Ross:"," Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?
"
"Rachel:"," Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
"
"Chandler:"," We can? All right, I'm tryin' that.
"
"Joey:"," Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care.
"
"Ross:"," Multiple orgasms!
"
"Chandler:"," So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!
"
"Joey:"," No plans, huh?
"
"Chandler:"," Not a one.
"
"Ross:"," Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, right, right, shut up.
"
"Monica:"," Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.
"
"Chandler:"," No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.
"
"Joey:"," Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.
"
"Phoebe:"," You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.
"
"Phoebe:"," No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony.
"
"Ross:"," Tony?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.
"
"Rachel:"," (waitressing) Does anybody want anything else?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. (Rachel gives him a dirty look) Nothing, just, just, I'm fine.
"
"Phoebe:"," (to Rachel) What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
"
"Rachel:"," It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
"
"Ross:"," That guy, he burns me up.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady.
"
"Chandler:"," Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that.
"
"Monica:"," Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own"".
"
"Phoebe:"," (rhythmically) Uh-huh, uh-huh.
"
"Joey:"," My god, Angela.
"
"Monica:"," Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her.
"
"Phoebe:"," Are you gonna go over there?
"
"Joey:"," No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. (he walks over to her) Hey, Angela.
"
"Joey:"," You look good.
"
"Joey:"," You don't say.
"
"Ross:"," So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?
"
"Rachel:"," Who?
"
"Ross:"," Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?
"
"Rachel:"," Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
"
"Ross:"," Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?
"
"Rachel:"," Sure.
"
"Joey:"," Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
"
"Joey:"," Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too.
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Joey:"," Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?
"
"Joey:"," You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica.
"
"Joey:"," Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you.
"
"Monica:"," Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
"
"Joey:"," Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is...
"
"Monica:"," (looking out window) Oh, god help us.
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
"
"Joey:"," Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me.
"
"Monica:"," What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
"
"Joey:"," (proud) I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?
"
"Ross:"," (on phone) Ok, bye. (hangs up) Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?
"
"Ross:"," It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
"
"Chandler:"," It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date.
"
"Ross:"," Nuh-uh.
"
"Chandler:"," Yuh-huh.
"
"Ross:"," So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwearyou want it to be dirty?
"
"Ross:"," (sheepish) No.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?
"
"Ross:"," Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way.
"
"Chandler:"," There you go.
"
"Monica:"," Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
"
"Joey:"," Yep.
"
"Monica:"," Which?
"
"Joey:"," Which what?
"
"Monica:"," You've never met Bob, have you?
"
"Joey:"," No, but he's...
"
"Monica:"," Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly...
"
"Monica:"," ...horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
"
"Chandler:"," Where are they? Where are they?
"
"Phoebe:"," This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
"
"Chandler:"," It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
"
"Phoebe:"," Eww, I don't wanna do that.
"
"Chandler:"," Here we go.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, have a good break-up.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, Janice.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?
"
"Chandler:"," What?
"
"Chandler:"," (covering) What... did you get me there?
"
"Chandler:"," Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
"
"Chandler:"," That's great.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?
"
"Chandler:"," That's it?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, it was really hard.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, you weren't there.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine.
"
"Rachel:"," But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Ross:"," What's goin' on?
"
"Rachel:"," Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine.
"
"Ross:"," Was your basket on top?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, but, there were no suds.
"
"Ross:"," So?
"
"Rachel:"," Well, you know, no suds, no save.
"
"Ross:"," No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. (to woman) That's my friend's machine.
"
"Ross:"," Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it.
"
"Ross:"," (to the crowd in the laundromat) All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. (to Rachel) Ok, let's do laundry.
"
"Rachel:"," That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
"
"Ross:"," Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent.
"
"Rachel:"," What's that?
"
"Ross:"," Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough.
"
"Ross:"," Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?
"
"Ross:"," Rach, have you never done this before?
"
"Rachel:"," Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.
"
"Ross:"," Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.
"
"Rachel:"," (holds a pair of panties in front of Ross) Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?
"
"Ross:"," (visibly nervous) Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call.
"
"Monica:"," (to Joey) He is so cute. (to Angela and Bob) So, where did you guys grow up?
"
"Monica:"," How, how did that happen?
"
"Joey:"," Oh my god.
"
"Monica:"," What?
"
"Joey:"," I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
"
"Joey:"," So, you and Angela, huh?
"
"Joey:"," You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually.
"
"Monica:"," I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.
"
"Monica:"," It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight.
"
"Monica:"," Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed.
"
"Chandler:"," Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice.
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do.
"
"Ross:"," That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? (the buzzer on the washer goes off) I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross...(opens up the washer) Uh-oh.
"
"Rachel:"," What uh-oh?
"
"Ross:"," (not wanting to tell her) Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. (singing) Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh.
"
"Rachel:"," Ross, what's the matter?
"
"Ross:"," Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done.
"
"Rachel:"," Come on, show me.
"
"Ross:"," All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, everything's pink.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone.
"
"Rachel:"," Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!
"
"Monica:"," Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?
"
"Monica:"," Oh my god.
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
"
"Joey:"," Come on, they're close.
"
"Monica:"," Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross.
"
"Monica:"," Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it?
"
"Joey:"," Well, who's to say what's true? I mean...
"
"Monica:"," Oh my god, what were you thinking?
"
"Joey:"," All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little.
"
"Monica:"," (hits him lightly) Oh!
"
"Joey:"," Ow!
"
"Monica:"," (leaving) I'm outta here.
"
"Joey:"," Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you.
"
"Monica:"," Really?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up.
"
"Monica:"," I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story.
"
"Joey:"," Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here.
"
"Chandler:"," Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, (Chandler flails his hand out and hits Janice in the eye)... boom.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?
"
"Chandler:"," (to Phoebe) I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh my god. (Chandler downs another espresso.) How many of those have you had?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, I don't know, a million?
"
"Phoebe:"," Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la.
"
"Chandler:"," I'm fine.
"
"Phoebe:"," All right.
"
"Chandler:"," I'm not fine. Here she comes.
"
"Phoebe:"," Wait here. Breathe.
"
"Chandler:"," How do you do that?
"
"Phoebe:"," It's like a gift.
"
"Chandler:"," We should always always break up together.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I'd like that.
"
"Ross:"," You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now.
"
"Rachel:"," Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart.
"
"Rachel:"," I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!
"
"Rachel:"," All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!
"
"Rachel:"," (to Ross) Yes! Did you see that?
"
"Ross:"," You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen.
"
"Rachel:"," I could not have done this without you.
"
"Ross:"," Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? (Ross turns and bangs his head on an open dryer door.) I'm fine, I'm fine.
"
"Rachel:"," Are you sure?
"
"Ross:"," No.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, are you sure you're ok?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah.
"
"Rachel:"," Does it still hurt?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah.
"
"Phoebe:"," (seeing Rachel's clothes) What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
"
"Monica:"," Hi.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey, how'd it go?
"
"Joey:"," Excellent.
"
"Monica:"," We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves.
"
"Ross:"," What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way.
"
"Monica:"," (notices his head) Oh, I'm sorry.
"
"Rachel:"," Where's Chandler?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, he needed some time to grieve.
"
"Chandler:"," I'm free! I'm free!
"
"Phoebe:"," That oughta do it.
"
"Rachel:"," (reading the program) Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!
"
"Chandler:"," You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom...
"
"Phoebe:"," The exclamation point in the title scares me. (Gesturing) Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!
"
"Ross:"," Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen.
"
"Joey:"," Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. (He goes into a song and dance number.)
"
"Rachel:"," God. I feel violated.
"
"Monica:"," Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?
"
"Chandler:"," (staring at a woman across the room) Ross, ten o'clock.
"
"Ross:"," Is it? Feels like two.
"
"Chandler:"," No, ten o'clock.
"
"Ross:"," What?
"
"Chandler:"," (sighs and gestures to explain) There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!
"
"Ross:"," Oh. Hel-lo!
"
"Chandler:"," She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!
"
"Monica:"," Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!
"
"Chandler:"," Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here.
"
"Ross:"," He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
"
"Chandler:"," Thank you, buddy.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys.
"
"Monica:"," You could do that!
"
"Chandler:"," Y'think?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue...
"
"Ross:"," C'mon! C'mon!
"
"Chandler:"," Here goes. (He walks over to her but just stands there.)
"
"Chandler:"," Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...(He clears his throat noisily)...hi.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. (He walks back to the others but she calls him back.)
"
"Joey:"," Whadja think?
"
"Joey:"," C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head.
"
"Chandler:"," (running back) She said yes!! She said yes!! (To Joey) Awful play, man. Whoah. (To All) Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way. (To Joey) Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. (He fishes a card out of his pocket.)
"
"Rachel:"," What is it?
"
"Joey:"," The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!
"
"Phoebe:"," Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, kids.
"
"Phoebe:"," (reading Monica's palm) No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?
"
"Chandler:"," It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
"
"Chandler:"," Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it.
"
"Chandler:"," We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?
"
"Joey:"," Who's Rick?
"
"Chandler:"," Who's Rick?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, so you're divorced?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?
"
"Chandler:"," So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?
"
"Chandler:"," Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?
"
"Chandler:"," So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?
"
"Chandler:"," ...Hm.
"
"Monica:"," Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
"
"Chandler:"," What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
"
"Monica:"," Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?
"
"Ross:"," No, of course not! (Thinks) ...Yeah, yeah, it is.
"
"Monica:"," What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
"
"Joey:"," I couldn't do it.
"
"Monica:"," Good for you, Joey.
"
"Joey:"," When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.
"
"Ross:"," Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-
"
"Ross:"," Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know.
"
"Monica:"," We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!
"
"Ross:"," Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-
"
"Rachel:"," Tah-daaah!
"
"Chandler:"," Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
"
"Rachel:"," Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for.
"
"Ross:"," Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, whaddya think?
"
"Monica:"," ...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
"
"Monica:"," How-how did that happen?
"
"Rachel:"," I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table.
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. (She moves it.) Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while.
"
"Phoebe:"," (to Rachel) I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
"
"Chandler:"," Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out.
"
"Monica:"," You guys, I am not that bad!
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, (psycho) Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
"
"Monica:"," That is so unfair!
"
"Ross:"," Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!
"
"Monica:"," Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook.
"
"Ross:"," Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away.
"
"Monica:"," Why not?
"
"Ross:"," Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
"
"Monica:"," I could do that.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout.
"
"Monica:"," Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
"
"Chandler:"," Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood...
"
"Monica:"," STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
"
"Ross:"," Monica? You're Mom.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
"
"Joey:"," (on phone) Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! (He hangs up and to all.) That was my agent. (He tosses and catches the phone.) My agent has just gotten me a job...in the new Al Pacino movie!
"
"Monica:"," Well, what's the part?
"
"Joey:"," Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! ""I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!""
"
"Phoebe:"," Seriously, what-what's the part?
"
"Joey:"," ""Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!""
"
"Ross:"," C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?
"
"Joey:"," ...I'm his (mumbles)
"
"Rachel:"," ..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?
"
"Joey:"," ...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt.
"
"Monica:"," (trying not to laugh) Oh my God.
"
"Joey:"," C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!
"
"Chandler:"," Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness.
"
"Joey:"," Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!
"
"Ross:"," You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?
"
"Monica:"," Alright, alright, alright...
"
"Joey:"," Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
"
"Monica:"," For what?
"
"Joey:"," Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
"
"Monica:"," Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there.
"
"Joey:"," Thank you! (He goes into the bathroom.)
"
"Chandler:"," Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
"
"Monica:"," He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
"
"Chandler:"," C'mon, we're roommates! (He goes into the bathroom, screams, and runs back out.) My eyes!! My eyes!!
"
"Monica:"," I warned you...
"
"Rachel:"," Who is being loud?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, you got the whole night, huh?
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. (He starts to raid the fridge.)
"
"Rachel:"," Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?
"
"Chandler:"," No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? (He has armloads of stuff.)
"
"Monica:"," Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that.
"
"Joey:"," Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity.
"
"Joey:"," Me?
"
"Joey:"," Right. Okay. Losing the robe. (He takes off the robe.) And the robe is lost.
"
"Joey:"," Well, I'm- I'm showering.
"
"Joey:"," Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here.
"
"Joey:"," I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
"
"Chandler:"," God, I love these fingers...
"
"Chandler:"," No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. (He kisses her and pulls her back down.)
"
"Chandler:"," Don't go.
"
"Chandler:"," (to himself) Too bad, she's leaving.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick.
"
"Chandler:"," What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!
"
"Chandler:"," I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us.
"
"Chandler:"," You.
"
"Chandler:"," Nono, just you.
"
"Chandler:"," Lose the other guys.
"
"Chandler:"," C'mon, we're great together, why not?
"
"Chandler:"," ...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'
"
"Chandler:"," I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish...
"
"Chandler:"," ...The second guy.
"
"Chandler:"," Sorry, the first guy runs the lips.
"
"Ross:"," Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?
"
"Monica:"," Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?
"
"Joey:"," Nope.
"
"Ross:"," No? What happened, big guy?
"
"Chandler:"," (to Ross) ""Big guy?""
"
"Ross:"," It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
"
"Joey:"," I got fired.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and...
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell.
"
"Joey:"," My mom will.
"
"Chandler:"," Something so sweet and...disturbing about that.
"
"Joey:"," Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it!
"
"Monica:"," Maybe this wasn't your shot.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you-you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..?
"
"Joey:"," Hard to tell, I was naked.
"
"Phoebe:"," No, I don't think this was your shot. I mean, I don't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah? That's so nice! (They hug.)
"
"Monica:"," I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys.
"
"Rachel:"," Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?
"
"Monica:"," (determined) Uh-huh!
"
"Rachel:"," Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
"
"Monica:"," Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. (He goes to her room.)
"
"Ross:"," She is a kook.
"
"Monica:"," (hums for a while, then gives up, and in her head) If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help! (She buries her head in her pillow.)
"
"Rachel:"," Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. (plays a chord, then the lights go out) OK, thank you very much.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, great. This is just...
"
"Rachel:"," Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!
"
"Monica:"," Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on.
"
"Rachel:"," Wow, you guys, this is big.
"
"Monica:"," (into phone) Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. (hangs up)
"
"Phoebe:"," Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. (to Monica) What's my number?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, I never call me.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre.
"
"Chandler:"," She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (pause) Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!
"
"Chandler:"," Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy.
"
"Joey:"," Hi everyone.
"
"Ross:"," And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani.
"
"Joey:"," Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone.
"
"Phoebe:"," (at window) Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles.
"
"Rachel:"," That had to hurt!
"
"Chandler:"," Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!
"
"Chandler:"," There you go!
"
"Chandler:"," You're definitely scaring here.
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. (takes phone)
"
"Monica:"," Hello?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, it's me.
"
"Monica:"," (to everyone) It's Chandler! (on phone) Are you OK?
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, I'm fine. (trying to cover up what he is saying) I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr.
"
"Monica:"," What?
"
"Chandler:"," I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
"
"Monica:"," I have no idea what you just said.
"
"Chandler:"," (angry) Put Joey on the phone.
"
"Joey:"," What's up man?
"
"Chandler:"," I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
"
"Joey:"," (to everyone) Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! (on phone) Chandler, listen. (says something intentionally garbled)
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind.
"
"Rachel:"," Alright, somebody.
"
"Monica:"," OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table.
"
"Ross:"," That's my sister.
"
"Joey:"," OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
"
"Monica:"," Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
"
"Ross:"," Pheebs, what about you?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh... Milwaukee.
"
"Rachel:"," Um... Ross?
"
"Ross:"," Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'
"
"Ross:"," The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, Rachel.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh come on, I already went.
"
"Monica:"," You did not go!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... (sigh)... oh, the foot of the bed.
"
"Ross:"," Step back.
"
"Joey:"," We have a winner!
"
"Rachel:"," I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park.
"
"Ross:"," Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line.
"
"Rachel:"," There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course.
"
"Ross:"," Come on.
"
"Rachel:"," No, he said we were holding up the people behind us.
"
"Ross:"," (sarcastically) And you didn't marry him because...?
"
"Rachel:"," I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of...
"
"Ross:"," Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah right.
"
"Ross:"," It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff.
"
"Rachel:"," (sigh) OK.
"
"Ross:"," But, um... I don't think that's going to be you.
"
"Rachel:"," You don't.
"
"Ross:"," Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future.
"
"Rachel:"," Really?
"
"Ross:"," Mmmm.
"
"Rachel:"," You do?
"
"Ross:"," I do.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh Ross, you're so great. (she playfully rubs his head and gets up)
"
"Joey:"," It's never gonna happen.
"
"Ross:"," (innocently) What?
"
"Joey:"," You and Rachel.
"
"Ross:"," (acts surprised) What? (pause) Why not?
"
"Joey:"," Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone.
"
"Ross:"," No, no, no. I'm not in the zone.
"
"Joey:"," Ross, you're mayor of the zone.
"
"Ross:"," I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to...
"
"Joey:"," Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever.
"
"Ross:"," I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. (Joey looks at him) What? What, now?
"
"Joey:"," Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' (Rachel comes into the room behind them)
"
"Ross:"," Shhhh!
"
"Rachel:"," What are you shushing?
"
"Ross:"," We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. (everyone is silent) Don't you hear that?
"
"Rachel:"," Ahhhh!
"
"Ross:"," See?
"
"Rachel:"," Huh. (she agrees, but looks very confused)
"
"Chandler:"," Um, is it sugarless?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it.
"
"Phoebe:"," (singing) New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... (she writes the lyrics down)
"
"Ross:"," (to Joey) OK, here goes.
"
"Joey:"," Are you going to do it?
"
"Ross:"," I'm going to do it.
"
"Joey:"," Do you want any help?
"
"Ross:"," You come out there, you're a dead man.
"
"Joey:"," Good luck, man.
"
"Ross:"," Thanks. (Joey hugs him) OK.
"
"Joey:"," OK. (Ross goes out on the balcony to talk to Rachel)
"
"Joey:"," Hey, where are you going?
"
"Monica:"," Outside.
"
"Joey:"," You can't go out there.
"
"Monica:"," Why not?
"
"Joey:"," Because of... the reason.
"
"Monica:"," And that would be?
"
"Joey:"," I, um, can't tell you.
"
"Monica:"," Joey, what's going on?
"
"Joey:"," OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you.
"
"Monica:"," About what?
"
"Joey:"," He's planning your birthday party.
"
"Monica:"," Oh my God! I love him!
"
"Joey:"," (as Phoebe enters) You'd better act surprised.
"
"Phoebe:"," About what?
"
"Monica:"," My surprise party!
"
"Phoebe:"," What surprise party?
"
"Monica:"," Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, he didn't tell me.
"
"Joey:"," Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing.
"
"Phoebe:"," This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
"
"Monica:"," No, you are not. We tell you stuff.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in. (Monica gestures at Phoebe to shut up; Joey looks surprised but pleased) Looks like I was second to last.
"
"Rachel:"," Hmmm... this is so nice.
"
"Ross:"," OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment.
"
"Rachel:"," OK.
"
"Ross:"," OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um....
"
"Rachel:"," Ohhh!!!! (looking at something behind Ross)
"
"Ross:"," Yes, yes, that's right...
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, look at the little cat! (a small kitten is on the roof behind Ross)
"
"Ross:"," What? (the cat jumps on his shoulders) Ow!
"
"Monica:"," (to Ross) This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
"
"Joey:"," Sorry, that was wax.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner.
"
"Ross:"," Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
"
"Rachel:"," During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
"
"Ross:"," (nonchalantly) Yeah?
"
"Chandler:"," You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection. (Jill gives him a stick of gum, and a strange look) 'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.
"
"Phoebe:"," (stops at a door) Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh. (they knock at the next door, Mr. Heckles answers) Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
"
"Phoebe:"," (trying to hold back the struggling cat) He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
"
"Phoebe:"," Wait a minute. What's his name?
"
"Rachel:"," Bob Buttons?
"
"Phoebe:"," (the cat runs away from her) Oooh! You are a very bad man!
"
"Rachel:"," Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty...
"
"Rachel:"," Wow. (she exhales in amazement, blowing the candle out)
"
"Ross:"," (rolling) Lucky sixes....
"
"Rachel:"," (entering with Paolo, arm in arm) Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica.
"
"Monica:"," (smitten) Hi!
"
"Rachel:"," And Joey....
"
"Monica:"," Hi!
"
"Rachel:"," And Ross.
"
"Monica:"," Hi!
"
"Rachel:"," (proudly) He doesn't speak much English.
"
"Rachel:"," Look at that!
"
"Ross:"," (jealous) So, um... where did Paolo come from?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh... Italy, I think.
"
"Ross:"," No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!
"
"Ross:"," That, that is funny... (to Joey).... and Rachel keeps touching him.
"
"Phoebe:"," Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
"
"Rachel:"," Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe.
"
"Phoebe:"," (smiling) You betcha!
"
"Chandler:"," (chewing gum) Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go.
"
"Chandler:"," Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. (Chandler slyly grabs the gum from the wall and slides it back in his mouth.)
"
"Chandler:"," Good save! We're back on track, and I'm... (grimacing) ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking.
"
"Chandler:"," (gasping) Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
"
"Ross:"," (mocking Paolo) Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah....
"
"Ross:"," Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
"
"Rachel:"," I have absolutely no idea.
"
"Ross:"," That's... that's classic.
"
"Rachel:"," (to Monica and Phoebe) Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!
"
"Monica:"," If you want, I'll do it.
"
"Phoebe:"," I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. (Rachel looks at her) But I won't.
"
"Rachel:"," God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry.
"
"Phoebe:"," You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... (they stare at her)... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK.
"
"Rachel:"," Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd....
"
"Ross:"," Paolo. Hi.
"
"Ross:"," Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing.
"
"Ross:"," Thing, yes. Thing.
"
"Ross:"," No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um...
"
"Ross:"," No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah! Se vice?
"
"Ross:"," So you do know a little English.
"
"Ross:"," Do you know the word crapweasel?
"
"Ross:"," That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!
"
"Chandler:"," OK.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... (time lapse)... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... (someone blows it out, the room gets completely dark)
"
"Ross:"," Thank you.
"
"Phoebe:"," Thanks.
"
"Ross:"," Kinda... spooky without any lights.
"
"Joey:"," (does a maniacal laugh) Bwah-hah-hah!
"
"Ross:"," OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah...
"
"Ross:"," Oh.. oh... oh.
"
"Joey:"," Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life.
"
"Chandler:"," Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape.
"
"Chandler:"," Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
"
"Chandler:"," Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'...
"
"Chandler:"," Yes please.
"
"Chandler:"," He's a he?
"
"Chandler:"," ...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?
"
"Rachel:"," Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be...
"
"Chandler:"," You did?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not.
"
"Chandler:"," Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?
"
"Monica:"," I did.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, I think so, yeah.
"
"Joey:"," Not me.
"
"Ross:"," Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did.
"
"Chandler:"," You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
"
"Ross:"," No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so...
"
"Chandler:"," Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?
"
"Phoebe:"," I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny...
"
"Chandler:"," Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?
"
"Chandler:"," WHAT IS IT?!
"
"Monica:"," Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.
"
"Monica:"," Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh my God! Calling from Rome! (Takes phone) Bon giorno, caro mio.
"
"Ross:"," (to Joey) So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
"
"Rachel:"," Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. (Showing off to Phoebe and Chandler) I'm talking to Rome.
"
"Monica:"," Hey dad, what's up? (Listens) Oh God. Ross, it's Nana.
"
"Ross:"," So, uh, how's she doing?
"
"Monica:"," How-how are you, Mom?
"
"Monica:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," Nothing.
"
"Monica:"," She is unbelievable, our mother is...
"
"Ross:"," Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover.
"
"Monica:"," Oh God!
"
"Monica:"," The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse.
"
"Ross:"," Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants.
"
"Ross:"," She looks so small.
"
"Monica:"," I know.
"
"Ross:"," Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now.
"
"Monica:"," G'bye, Nana. (She kisses her on the forehead.)
"
"Ross:"," Bye, Nana.
"
"Monica:"," Ross!
"
"Ross:"," Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite..
"
"Ross:"," She's not- past, she's present, she's back.
"
"Ross:"," I, uh, I'll go see. (He goes in)
"
"Ross:"," Now she's passed.
"
"Chandler:"," I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?
"
"Rachel:"," (exasperated) Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, you have homosexual hair.
"
"Rachel:"," So, um, did she...
"
"Ross:"," Twice.
"
"Joey:"," Twice?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, that sucks!
"
"Joey:"," You guys okay?
"
"Ross:"," I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh...
"
"Phoebe:"," Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
"
"Ross:"," Nono, she's gone.
"
"Monica:"," We checked. A lot.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know? (She circles her hand around her right shoulder. Chandler, sitting on her right, draws back nervously) Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her.
"
"Rachel:"," Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? (Gives her a pencil)
"
"Phoebe:"," Thanks!
"
"Rachel:"," Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
"
"Joey:"," Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food! (realises his tactlessness) ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?
"
"Phoebe:"," Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. (Hands back the pencil)
"
"Ross:"," I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
"
"Ross:"," (sarcastic) I don't see why not.
"
"Ross:"," Here's my retainer!
"
"Monica:"," Dad!
"
"Monica:"," You what?
"
"Monica:"," Define fun.
"
"Monica:"," ...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun.
"
"Monica:"," That's probably what they'll say.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, gorgeous.
"
"Chandler:"," No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake.
"
"Chandler:"," So, uh... what do you think it is about me?
"
"Chandler:"," ...Quality, right, great.
"
"Chandler:"," Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll.
"
"Chandler:"," No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him.
"
"Chandler:"," Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
"
"Ross:"," (holding a dress out from inside the closet) This one?
"
"Ross:"," I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the burgundy.
"
"Ross:"," Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. (Starts to climb over the furniture)
"
"Ross:"," Okay. Um, how about these? (Holds out a pair)
"
"Ross:"," And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
"
"Ross:"," (forages around) Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work.
"
"Ross:"," No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back.
"
"Ross:"," Oh my God..
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, just... just Nana stuff.
"
"Ross:"," (entering) How we doing, you guys ready?
"
"Monica:"," Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
"
"Ross:"," Some days it's all I can think about.
"
"Phoebe:"," (entering) Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, you-you mean your earrings?
"
"Phoebe:"," What'd I say?
"
"Rachel:"," (sticking her foot out) Hm-m.
"
"Monica:"," Are these the shoes?
"
"Rachel:"," Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
"
"Ross:"," What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?
"
"Joey:"," (entering with Chandler) Morning. We ready to go?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?
"
"Monica:"," It was a really beautiful service.
"
"Joey:"," What?
"
"Chandler:"," Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger.
"
"Joey:"," Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. (He has a pocket TV)
"
"Chandler:"," You're watching a football game at a funeral?
"
"Joey:"," No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception.
"
"Chandler:"," You are a frightening, frightening man.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
"
"Ross:"," Oh, I hope they're not ruined.
"
"Phoebe:"," God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!
"
"Ross:"," I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- (Not looking where he is going he falls into an open grave)
"
"Ross:"," I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh.
"
"Ross:"," What, what is it?
"
"Phoebe:"," You missed a belt loop.
"
"Ross:"," Oh! No-n-
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, it's in spasm.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, no-
"
"Chandler:"," Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?
"
"Ross:"," I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great.
"
"Monica:"," Wow, those pills really worked, huh?
"
"Ross:"," Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister (Kisses Monica), I love Pheebs... (Hugs her)
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! That's so nice...
"
"Ross:"," ...Chandler!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey.
"
"Ross:"," (hugs him) And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me.
"
"Ross:"," Rachel. Rachel Rachel. (Sits down beside her) I love you the most.
"
"Rachel:"," (humouring him) Oh, well you know who I love the most?
"
"Ross:"," No.
"
"Rachel:"," You!
"
"Ross:"," Oh.. you don't get it! (Passes out and slumps across her)
"
"Joey:"," (hides the TV, but he still has an earphone) Just a, uh... hearing disability.
"
"Joey:"," Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
"
"Rachel:"," (still trapped under Ross) Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker?
"
"Monica:"," Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all.
"
"Monica:"," That sounds like Nana.
"
"Monica:"," ...I can imagine.
"
"Monica:"," That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?
"
"Monica:"," How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example.
"
"Monica:"," Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
"
"Monica:"," Huh.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, I think so.
"
"Monica:"," Thank you. They're yours.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey, who's this little naked guy?
"
"Ross:"," That little naked guy would be me.
"
"Rachel:"," Aww, look at the little thing.
"
"Ross:"," Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?
"
"Chandler:"," Who are those people?
"
"Ross:"," Got me.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle. (Reads the back) 'Me and the gang at Java Joe's'.
"
"Rachel:"," Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?
"
"Monica:"," Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?
"
"Ross:"," Looks like a fun gang. (They all look at each other and smile)
"
"Joey:"," Ooh, look-look-look-look-look! I got Monica naked!
"
"Ross:"," (looking) Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, Lowell.
"
"Chandler:"," So how's it going there in Financial Services?
"
"Chandler:"," Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not.
"
"Chandler:"," Really.
"
"Chandler:"," So- you can tell?
"
"Chandler:"," So you don't think I have a, a quality?
"
"Chandler:"," He is?
"
"Chandler:"," Out of my league. I could get a Brian. (Brian enters behind him) If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. (Sees him) Hey, Brian.
"
"Rachel:"," Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?
"
"Rachel:"," It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job.
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? (everyone in the place raises their hand) Oh, look at that.
"
"Rachel:"," Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. (picks up the tip he leaves) Only $98.50 to go.
"
"Monica:"," Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?
"
"Ross:"," No, they're not.
"
"Monica:"," Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them.
"
"Ross:"," You're wrong.
"
"Monica:"," I am not wrong.
"
"Ross:"," You're wrong.
"
"Monica:"," No, I just talked to them.
"
"Ross:"," (getting up, upset) I'm calling Mom.
"
"Joey:"," Hey, hey.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey.
"
"Chandler:"," And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
"
"Joey:"," Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model.
"
"Chandler:"," That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman.
"
"Phoebe:"," What were you modeling for?
"
"Joey:"," You know those posters for the city free clinic?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?
"
"Phoebe:"," You know, the asthma guy was really cute.
"
"Chandler:"," Do you know which one you're gonna be?
"
"Joey:"," No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... (crosses fingers)
"
"Chandler:"," Good luck, man. I hope you get it.
"
"Joey:"," Thanks.
"
"Ross:"," (to Monica) Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving.
"
"Monica:"," Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's.
"
"Ross:"," Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
"
"Monica:"," You know, they're not actually supposed to have... (Ross looks at her sheepishly) I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah.
"
"Monica:"," And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, every single one of them.
"
"Monica:"," Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar.
"
"Monica:"," So you're free Thursday, then.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah. Oh, can I come?
"
"Monica:"," Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?
"
"Rachel:"," Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go.
"
"Chandler:"," I thought it was $98.50.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup.
"
"Ross:"," Well, I'm off to Carol's.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?
"
"Ross:"," (mimicking) Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner.
"
"Ross:"," Hi, is uh, is Carol here?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in.
"
"Ross:"," Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum.
"
"Ross:"," Kinda like a big face without skin.
"
"Ross:"," Ok. (browsing the apartment) Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian.
"
"Ross:"," (picking up a book) Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic.
"
"Ross:"," The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?
"
"Ross:"," You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?
"
"Ross:"," Do you uh, do you talk about me?
"
"Ross:"," Really?
"
"Ross:"," Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.
"
"Chandler:"," I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.
"
"Monica:"," Hey, Rach, did you make your money?
"
"Rachel:"," No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop.
"
"Monica:"," Rach, here's your mail.
"
"Rachel:"," Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
"
"Monica:"," (insistently) No, here's your mail.
"
"Rachel:"," Thanks, you can just put it on the table.
"
"Monica:"," (gives her an envelope) Would you just open it?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh my god, oh, you guys are great.
"
"Monica:"," We all chipped in.
"
"Joey:"," (to Monica) We did?
"
"Monica:"," (to Joey) You owe me 20 bucks.
"
"Rachel:"," Thank you. Thank you so much!
"
"Monica:"," (hands Chandler a bag) Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns.
"
"Rachel:"," Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?
"
"Chandler:"," All right, I'm nine years old.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, I hate this story.
"
"Chandler:"," We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh my god.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
"
"Joey:"," Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. (pretends to spray cologne) Aramis? Aramis?
"
"Joey:"," I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
"
"Joey:"," I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back.
"
"Joey:"," Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?
"
"Joey:"," Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?
"
"Joey:"," What's wrong?
"
"Joey:"," Oh. What?
"
"Joey:"," Wait, wait, wait!
"
"Joey:"," So I guess you all saw it.
"
"Rachel:"," Saw what?
"
"Phoebe:"," No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious.
"
"Joey:"," Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
"
"Chandler:"," Tonight, on a very special Blossom.
"
"Monica:"," Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. (notices Ross is depressed) What?
"
"Ross:"," I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
"
"Monica:"," All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping.
"
"Ross:"," That's closer.
"
"Rachel:"," I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, you must stop shooping.
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.
"
"Joey:"," Chandler, will you just come in already?
"
"Chandler:"," No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.
"
"Phoebe:"," Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.
"
"Joey:"," Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.
"
"Monica:"," That's not a question.
"
"Joey:"," But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.
"
"Monica:"," All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.
"
"Ross:"," Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child.
"
"Monica:"," Ah!
"
"Ross:"," Ok, Mom never hit.
"
"Phoebe:"," (stirring pot) Ok, all done.
"
"Monica:"," What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions.
"
"Monica:"," Why would we do that?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died.
"
"Monica:"," Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. (she starts to leave, and hits everyone with her skis) Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!
"
"Chandler:"," The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
"
"Joey:"," The balloon?
"
"Chandler:"," No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?
"
"Rachel:"," I can't, I gotta go.
"
"Chandler:"," Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
"
"Phoebe:"," Almost never.
"
"Monica:"," Got the keys? or Got the keys!
"
"Rachel:"," Ok.
"
"Ross:"," Ok, ok, here we go. (he crouches down near her stomach) Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but...
"
"Ross:"," Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid.
"
"Ross:"," (quickly talking) Hello, baby. Hello, hello.
"
"Rachel:"," I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean.
"
"Monica:"," Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?
"
"Rachel:"," We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
"
"Monica:"," No I don't.
"
"Rachel:"," Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys.""
"
"Monica:"," No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?""
"
"Rachel:"," No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys"".
"
"Chandler:"," Do either of you have the keys?
"
"Monica:"," (panicked) The oven is on.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, I gotta get my ticket!
"
"Joey:"," Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key.
"
"Monica:"," Well then get it, get it!
"
"Joey:"," That tone will not make me go any faster.
"
"Monica:"," (angry) Joey!
"
"Joey:"," That one will.
"
"Ross:"," And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?
"
"Ross:"," Shh! (singing) Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! (to Carol) Hey, uh, did you just feel that?
"
"Ross:"," Does it always, uh--?
"
"Ross:"," (singing) Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo.
"
"Ross:"," (singin) Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts.
"
"Joey:"," Nope, not that one.
"
"Monica:"," Can you go any faster with that?
"
"Joey:"," Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math.
"
"Monica:"," Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
"
"Chandler:"," (sarcastic) For an emergency just like this.
"
"Rachel:"," (grabs Chandler by the shirt) All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this (makes a gesture like a stewardess pointing out exits) right now. But I'm not.
"
"Monica:"," I swear you said you had the keys.
"
"Rachel:"," No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys.
"
"Monica:"," Why would I have the keys?
"
"Rachel:"," Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
"
"Monica:"," But I didn't.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, you should have.
"
"Monica:"," Why?
"
"Rachel:"," Because!
"
"Monica:"," Why?
"
"Rachel:"," Because!
"
"Monica:"," Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! (starting to cry) Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.
"
"Monica:"," Well, the turkey's burnt. (checking pots) Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined.
"
"Ross:"," Here we come, walkin' down thethis doesn't smell like Mom's.
"
"Monica:"," No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? (picks up the pan of badly burnt potatoes) Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys.
"
"Joey:"," Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?
"
"Joey:"," You call that delicious?
"
"Monica:"," Stop it, stop it, stop it!
"
"Chandler:"," Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh.
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Phoebe:"," Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
"
"Joey:"," I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
"
"Monica:"," Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!
"
"Phoebe:"," It's nice that he has someone.
"
"Chandler:"," Shall I carve?
"
"Rachel:"," By all means.
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?
"
"Ross:"," I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
"
"Monica:"," (holding sandwich) Does anybody wanna split this with me?
"
"Joey:"," Oh, I will.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, you guys have to make a wish.
"
"Monica:"," Make a wish?
"
"Phoebe:"," Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?
"
"Joey:"," The bigger half.
"
"Chandler:"," I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.
"
"Ross:"," And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.
"
"Rachel:"," And a crappy New Year.
"
"Chandler:"," Here, here!
"
"Ross:"," Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet.
"
"Monica:"," W-wait. What is that?
"
"Ross:"," 'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
"
"Monica:"," No, no, I don't.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?
"
"Ross:"," My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
"
"Phoebe:"," That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!
"
"Monica:"," Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so...
"
"Monica:"," Why don't you just get a roommate?
"
"Ross:"," Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe- (Realises) ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'.
"
"Phoebe:"," So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman.
"
"Chandler:"," Might wanna open with the snowman.
"
"Monica:"," So, how'd it go?
"
"Joey:"," Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job.
"
"Ross:"," How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
"
"Joey:"," I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political.
"
"Monica:"," So what are you gonna be?
"
"Joey:"," Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?
"
"Rachel:"," Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? (They all protest and hit her with cushions) Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?
"
"Chandler:"," Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!
"
"Rachel:"," Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, you wish!
"
"Chandler:"," It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner.
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm.
"
"Rachel:"," Phoebe, you're on.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, oh, good.
"
"Rachel:"," (Into microphone) Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!
"
"Phoebe:"," (Takes mike) Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. (Shakes bell as an introduction) (Sung:)
"
"Phoebe:"," (Sung)
"
"Phoebe:"," (Sung)
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!
"
"Chandler:"," (Quietly, to the others) That guy's going home with a note!
"
"Phoebe:"," Could you speak up please?
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, we're gonna take a short break. (Goes over to their table)
"
"Joey:"," Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!
"
"Ross:"," Come here, Marcel. Sit here. (Marcel wanders off)
"
"Rachel:"," Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?
"
"Ross:"," Just a smidge.
"
"Phoebe:"," David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical.
"
"Monica:"," I think it's romantic.
"
"Phoebe:"," Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah!
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions...
"
"Chandler:"," Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact.
"
"Phoebe:"," No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice.
"
"Monica:"," What?!
"
"Ross:"," C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact!
"
"Chandler:"," I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped.
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!
"
"Chandler:"," I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!
"
"Joey:"," Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late.
"
"Chandler:"," Too many jokes... must mock Joey!
"
"Joey:"," Nice shoes, huh? (He wiggles his foot and the bells tinkle)
"
"Chandler:"," Aah, y'killing me!
"
"Monica:"," Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
"
"Ross:"," Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?
"
"Monica:"," Do you always have to bring him here?
"
"Ross:"," I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces...
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, alright, I have a question, then.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?
"
"Phoebe:"," Sure.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh yeah, right now.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, now you're just kinda tidying.
"
"Phoebe:"," I can hop. (She hops onto the table)
"
"Ross:"," So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
"
"Monica:"," I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby.
"
"Chandler:"," Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
"
"Monica:"," Yeah.
"
"Joey:"," You know more than one Fun Bobby?
"
"Chandler:"," I happen to know a Fun Bob.
"
"Rachel:"," (Brings Joey a mug of coffee) Okay, here we go...
"
"Joey:"," Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!
"
"Rachel:"," (Glances at Joey and then sips his coffee) There. Now there is.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates.
"
"Joey:"," Uh, four.
"
"Ross:"," Four.
"
"Rachel:"," Five.
"
"Ross:"," Five. (Buries his head in his hands)
"
"Rachel:"," Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?
"
"Ross:"," Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who.
"
"Ross:"," Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now.
"
"Monica:"," What's the matter?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands...
"
"Chandler:"," That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night.
"
"Ross:"," Really.
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing.
"
"Ross:"," What, uh... what juggling thing?
"
"Chandler:"," With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
"
"Ross:"," No.
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon...
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?
"
"Phoebe:"," No, no, he hasn't been around.
"
"Phoebe:"," Minsk?
"
"Phoebe:"," I know where Minsk is.
"
"Phoebe:"," So when, when do you leave?
"
"Phoebe:"," Hello?
"
"Phoebe:"," Hi.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so (Puts on a fake cheery voice) congratulations! This is so exciting!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, you're not going? (Fake disappointed voice) Oh, why?
"
"Phoebe:"," So-so you're really not going?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh don't do that.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh no no.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, but I can't do that-
"
"Phoebe:"," It's your thing, and-
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, um, stay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Stay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Getting so good at that! (She hops on)
"
"Chandler:"," You remember Janice.
"
"Monica:"," Vividly.
"
"Monica:"," Hi.
"
"Joey:"," Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! (She enters, followed by a young boy and a younger girl)...You brought your kids.
"
"Ross:"," Par-tay!
"
"Monica:"," That thing is not coming in here.
"
"Ross:"," 'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?
"
"Monica:"," I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
"
"Ross:"," Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
"
"Monica:"," Alright. Just keep him away from me.
"
"Ross:"," Thank you. (She walks off) C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? (Marcel runs off) Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later.
"
"Monica:"," Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?
"
"Rachel:"," Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
"
"Phoebe:"," And then... your face is bloated?
"
"Rachel:"," No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party? (To Monica) Are people eating my dip?
"
"Joey:"," Wow, that's, uh, dirty.
"
"Joey:"," Hey, kids...
"
"Ross:"," (Watching Marcel play with Phoebe. To Chandler) Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in.
"
"Chandler:"," (Imitating) But you found me!
"
"Chandler:"," Kill me. Kill me now.
"
"Monica:"," Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
"
"Joey:"," (Approaching) Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died?
"
"Chandler:"," Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-
"
"Chandler:"," I'm sorry you misunderstood...
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, will you give me the thing. (Snatches the camera)
"
"Phoebe:"," Hi, Max!
"
"Phoebe:"," Are you alright?
"
"Phoebe:"," You're going to Minsk.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say (Hits him) 'no! No! I can't understand that!'.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. (He does so) And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me.
"
"Phoebe:"," And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it. (They kiss) I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
"
"Joey:"," There y'go, kids.
"
"Chandler:"," (To a woman who he has clearly just met) And then the peacock bit me. (Laughs) Please kiss me at midnight. (She leaves)
"
"Joey:"," You seen Sandy?
"
"Chandler:"," Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you.
"
"Rachel:"," Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing.
"
"Rachel:"," The bll is drrbing!
"
"Chandler:"," And the moment of joy is upon us.
"
"Joey:"," Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
"
"Phoebe:"," Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
"
"Monica:"," Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. (Makes kiss noise)
"
"Phoebe:"," I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
"
"Rachel:"," I can't kiss anyone.
"
"Monica:"," So I'm kissing everyone?
"
"Joey:"," Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.
"
"Ross:"," Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
"
"Chandler:"," Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!
"
"Joey:"," Alrightalrightalright. (Kisses him. Ross takes a photo) There.
"
"Ross:"," (Watching Marcel and talking to Rachel) I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back.
"
"Rachel:"," ...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
"
"Phoebe:"," Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
"
"Monica:"," Why?
"
"Phoebe:"," Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right.
"
"Monica:"," Oh my God. (Grabs Phoebe and turns her away) Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression.
"
"Phoebe:"," Where? (Turns to face him) Ooh, come to Momma.
"
"Monica:"," He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool.
"
"Phoebe:"," We should do something. Whistle.
"
"Monica:"," We are not going to whistle.
"
"Phoebe:"," Come on, do it.
"
"Monica:"," No!
"
"Phoebe:"," Do it!
"
"Monica:"," No!
"
"Phoebe:"," Do it do it do it!
"
"Monica:"," (Shouts to the guy) Woo-woo!
"
"Phoebe:"," I can't believe you did that!
"
"Monica:"," Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?
"
"Phoebe:"," I just wish there was something we could do. (Bends down and talks to him) Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!
"
"Monica:"," Phoebe, what are you doing?
"
"Phoebe:"," Maybe nobody's tried this.
"
"Monica:"," I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic.
"
"Monica:"," Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked.
"
"Monica:"," I wish all guys could be like him.
"
"Phoebe:"," I know.
"
"Chandler:"," Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
"
"Monica:"," He doesn't have anyone.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible.
"
"Joey:"," I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! (Turns on the TV)
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax.
"
"Rachel:"," No way, forget it.
"
"Joey:"," C'mon, she's your mom!
"
"Chandler:"," Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?
"
"Rachel:"," Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'
"
"Ross:"," C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast.
"
"Chandler:"," You can say that because she's not your mom.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, please...
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, hi sweetie. (They kiss)
"
"Ross:"," When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
"
"Monica:"," Last night.
"
"Ross:"," Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey hey hey! She's on!
"
"Phoebe:"," Your mom was arrested?
"
"Chandler:"," Shhh, busy beaming with pride.
"
"Chandler:"," Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
"
"Chandler:"," THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
"
"Chandler:"," This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
"
"Chandler:"," ...And then he burst into flames.
"
"Monica:"," Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports.
"
"Phoebe:"," What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
"
"Monica:"," Nah... not-not special enough.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
"
"Monica:"," Waaay too special.
"
"Chandler:"," Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little.
"
"Ross:"," (Entering) What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
"
"Chandler:"," I know I am.
"
"Monica:"," Yeah.
"
"Phoebe:"," I'm in.
"
"Ross:"," Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy.
"
"Rachel:"," Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.
"
"Ross:"," ...But a man can change. (Downs a shot)
"
"Ross:"," Anyone want me to appraise anything?
"
"Rachel:"," Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer.
"
"Chandler:"," Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. (A woman emerges from the toilet behind him and he tries to pretend he was in the other one)
"
"Ross:"," Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
"
"Ross:"," No. It's the one he's licking.
"
"Ross:"," You're good.
"
"Ross:"," The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
"
"Ross:"," When?
"
"Ross:"," The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
"
"Ross:"," Please.
"
"Ross:"," Right.
"
"Ross:"," Uh-oh...
"
"Joey:"," Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
"
"Ross:"," Hey, is Chandler here?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell... (Joey shakes his head) Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?
"
"Joey:"," Right. No big deal.
"
"Ross:"," Okay.
"
"Joey:"," In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
"
"Ross:"," What code?
"
"Joey:"," You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!
"
"Chandler:"," What are you guys doing out here?
"
"Ross:"," Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.
"
"Ross:"," No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. (Goes back inside and shuts the door)
"
"Ross:"," Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum.
"
"Joey:"," Ross, how could you let this happen?
"
"Ross:"," I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's...
"
"Joey:"," You don't think my mom's sexy?
"
"Ross:"," Well... not in the same way...
"
"Joey:"," I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?
"
"Ross:"," Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here...
"
"Rachel:"," Hey.
"
"Ross:"," Hey.
"
"Rachel:"," What're you guys doing out here?
"
"Ross:"," Well, not playing raquetball!
"
"Joey:"," He forgot to leave his grip size!
"
"Ross:"," He didn't get the goggles!
"
"Rachel:"," Well,sounds like you two have issues.
"
"Rachel:"," Goodbye, baby.
"
"Ross:"," Do they wait for me to do this?
"
"Joey:"," So are you gonna tell him?
"
"Ross:"," Why would I tell him?
"
"Joey:"," How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might.
"
"Ross:"," Oh...
"
"Monica:"," (Entering) What are you guys doing here?
"
"Joey:"," Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
"
"Monica:"," ...What did I ask?
"
"Monica:"," Hi.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hi.
"
"Monica:"," What are you doing here?
"
"Phoebe:"," Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?
"
"Monica:"," I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
"
"Phoebe:"," No. (Monica brushes Coma Guy's hair in the other direction) No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?
"
"Monica:"," How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
"
"Phoebe:"," Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! (Whips back the sheet to reveal him wearing new pajamas.)
"
"Chandler:"," Oh my God.
"
"Ross:"," You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
"
"Chandler:"," I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh... (He has caught sight of Joey scowling at him) I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom.
"
"Chandler:"," What?
"
"Ross:"," I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-
"
"Chandler:"," (To Joey) You knew about this?
"
"Joey:"," Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing.
"
"Chandler:"," I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!
"
"Joey:"," Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened.
"
"Ross:"," Thanks, man, big help.
"
"Chandler:"," (To Ross) I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
"
"Ross:"," I wasn't- I mean, I-
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you.
"
"Ross:"," I know-
"
"Chandler:"," I can't believe you did this. (Walks toward the door)
"
"Ross:"," Chandler-
"
"Joey:"," Me neither, y'know what-
"
"Chandler:"," I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
"
"Joey:"," What are you mad at me for?!
"
"Ross:"," Chandler-
"
"Chandler:"," You gotta let me slam the door! (Leaves; slams the door)
"
"Joey:"," (Shouting after him) Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did! (To Ross) See what happens when you break the code?
"
"Ross:"," Joey-
"
"Joey:"," Ah! (Points to door) Huh? (Leaves and slams the door)
"
"Monica:"," Hey.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey.
"
"Monica:"," (Reading) 'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'.
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?
"
"Monica:"," (Reads) Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'.
"
"Phoebe:"," (Walks up with her guitar) Hey Rach.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hello.
"
"Monica:"," Hello.
"
"Phoebe:"," Going to the hospital tonight?
"
"Monica:"," No, you?
"
"Phoebe:"," No, you?
"
"Monica:"," You just asked me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay, maybe it was a trick question. (Plays a few chords) Um, Rachel can we do this now?
"
"Rachel:"," Okay. (Writes a little more) I am so hot!
"
"Joey:"," (To Ross, on the couch) Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout.
"
"Ross:"," I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
"
"Joey:"," C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all.
"
"Rachel:"," (Into microphone) Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me. (Monica gives her a look) 'Kay. (Sung:)
"
"Rachel:"," (Into mike) Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!
"
"Chandler:"," What was that?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a...
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? (Goes to the counter)
"
"Joey:"," (Laughing) Mother-Kisser... (Sees Ross's look) I'll shut up.
"
"Ross:"," Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?
"
"Chandler:"," Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!
"
"Ross:"," (To the rest of Central Perk) We're rehearsing a Greek play.
"
"Chandler:"," That's very funny. We done now?
"
"Ross:"," No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?
"
"Chandler:"," That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, 'you' can't, or (Points to Chandler) you can't? (Chandler grabs his finger) Okay, that's my finger. (Chandler twists it and Ross goes down on one knee) That's, that's my knee. (To Central Perk) Still doing the play. Aaah!
"
"Phoebe:"," Alright, whadyou do with him?
"
"Monica:"," Oh! You're awake!
"
"Phoebe:"," Look at you! How, how do you feel?
"
"Monica:"," You look good!
"
"Monica:"," Oh, sorry.
"
"Phoebe:"," I'm Phoebe Buffay.
"
"Monica:"," I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, we both have.
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, actually it's just from me.
"
"Monica:"," I got you the foot massager.
"
"Phoebe:"," You know who shaved you? That was me.
"
"Monica:"," I read to you.
"
"Phoebe:"," I sang. (To Monica) Hah!
"
"Monica:"," Oh, my pleasure.
"
"Phoebe:"," You're welcome.
"
"Phoebe:"," What, that's it?
"
"Monica:"," ""See you around?""
"
"Monica:"," Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?""
"
"Phoebe:"," I don't think you mean that.
"
"Monica:"," This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe.
"
"Phoebe:"," Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
"
"Chandler:"," No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough.
"
"Chandler:"," You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
"
"Chandler:"," Really stupid.
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah. No. No...
"
"Ross:"," Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door.
"
"Joey:"," Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything.
"
"Ross:"," You're kidding.
"
"Joey:"," No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?""
"
"Ross:"," Wow!
"
"Joey:"," Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb?""
"
"Ross:"," 'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?""
"
"Joey:"," That makes more sense.
"
"Ross:"," So, what's going on now?
"
"Joey:"," I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! (Goes back to the door) I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. (Looks through the spyhole)
"
"Ross:"," Whaddya see?
"
"Joey:"," Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, okay.
"
"Chandler:"," Nice save.
"
"Ross:"," (Very politely) Mrs. Bing.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey.
"
"Ross:"," You mean that?
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, why not. (They shake hands) So I told her.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah? How'd it go?
"
"Chandler:"," Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
"
"Ross:"," Well, howdya feel?
"
"Chandler:"," Pretty good! I told her.
"
"Ross:"," Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? (Wags his finger at Chandler, then puts it down) But.. we don't have to go down that road.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'.
"
"Monica:"," What's a 'niffle'?
"
"Joey:"," You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
"
"Rachel:"," Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist...
"
"Ross:"," Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!
"
"Rachel:"," Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!
"
"Chandler:"," No-no-no-no, we're done.
"
"Monica:"," Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. (pauses, listens to person on phone) Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape.
"
"Joey:"," Ross, did you really read all these baby books?
"
"Ross:"," Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! (snaps fingers)
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. (Joey grimaces)
"
"Chandler:"," And, we're done with the yogurt. (Sets yogurt down on table)
"
"Phoebe:"," (softly) Sorry. (Camera pans back to Monica, still on phone)
"
"Monica:"," Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? (listens to Aunt Syl on phone, looks shocked) Nice talk, Aunt Syl. (in New York accent) You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?
"
"Joey:"," Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? (measures about 2 inches with his thumb and index finger) This is your baby. (in baby-like voice) Hi Daddy!
"
"Ross:"," (waves) Hello!
"
"Joey:"," (in baby-like voice) How come you don't live with Mommy? (pause; shows Ross less than amused) How come Mommy lives with that other lady? (pause; Ross still looks less than amused; Joey smiling) What's a lesbian? (playfully hits Ross)
"
"Rachel:"," Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos (touching Paolo's nose with forefinger with each syllable)
"
"Monica:"," So, did I hear Poconos?
"
"Rachel:"," Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend.
"
"Phoebe:"," Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, that's a big step.
"
"Rachel:"," I know...
"
"Chandler:"," (to Ross) Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!
"
"Ross:"," Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be...(makes flinging motions with hands) flung by now?
"
"Rachel:"," I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally...
"
"Ross:"," ...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? (pauses, looks suddenly inspired) I could call immigration!
"
"Joey:"," I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands...
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!
"
"Joey:"," Need a new table.
"
"Chandler:"," You think?
"
"Ross:"," Hey, hello! mmwa! (kisses Carol) I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna.
"
"Ross:"," (pauses) I'm pretty sure that it is...
"
"Ross:"," (making flinging gestures with hands) Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, that's great, that is great! (Hugs and kisses Carol. Then picks up a picture frame)
"
"Ross:"," Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?
"
"Ross:"," (surprised, chuckling nervously) Of course it's your friend Tanya. (looks up frightenedly)
"
"Ross:"," (chuckles nervously) The sex? (chuckles) Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya (miming washing hair, that's the best I could think of), yaw...
"
"Ross:"," Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!
"
"Ross:"," No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! (pauses) Or isn't...
"
"Ross:"," Susan...
"
"Ross:"," Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!
"
"Ross:"," (flailing arms in protest) Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!
"
"Ross:"," Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?
"
"Ross:"," (interrupts) No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go.
"
"Ross:"," No problem, ok, mmmwa (kisses Carol) oh, mmmwa (kisses Carol's stomach, then punches Susan's shoulder) Susan... (Ross leaves.)
"
"Ross:"," (on intercom) Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. (Carol and Susan laugh)
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?
"
"Joey:"," That's the rule.
"
"Chandler:"," What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!
"
"Joey:"," How'd you get to that?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio
"
"Joey:"," You knew about that?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination.
"
"Joey:"," Ok, ok, How about if we split it?
"
"Chandler:"," What do you mean, like, buy it together?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah
"
"Chandler:"," You think we're ready for something like that?
"
"Joey:"," Why not?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?
"
"Joey:"," Why, are you moving out?
"
"Chandler:"," I'm not moving out.
"
"Joey:"," You'd tell me if you were moving out right
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip...
"
"Joey:"," Aw, I know all about Kip!
"
"Chandler:"," It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly.
"
"Joey:"," Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?
"
"Chandler:"," Aw, don't do that
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, thanks. (assistant leaves, then walks back in)
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, Racquela's right, yeah!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!
"
"Rachel:"," (to Ross) I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows....
"
"Monica:"," And Monica knows...
"
"Ross:"," Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!
"
"Monica:"," Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me.
"
"Joey:"," So what's it gonna be? (Monica whispers in Joey's ear. Ross gets up and waves arms frantically in protest)
"
"Ross:"," Waitohheyhuh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!
"
"Monica:"," I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!
"
"Joey:"," Or an uncle...
"
"Ross:"," Hi Pheebs!
"
"Rachel:"," Pheebs!
"
"Phoebe:"," Fine!
"
"Monica:"," Phoebe, what's the matter?
"
"Phoebe:"," Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, right, that's me!
"
"Joey:"," Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on.
"
"Chandler:"," Fine. (Joey and Chandler walk towards the door)
"
"Monica:"," Phoebe, what is it?
"
"Phoebe:"," All right, you know Paolo?
"
"Ross:"," I'm familiar with his work, yes...
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, he made a move on me.
"
"Joey:"," Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!
"
"Chandler:"," More coffee over here, please!
"
"Monica:"," Well, what happened?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. (A flashback starts Paolo, lying on massage table, moving his hands up Phoebe's legs.)
"
"Ross:"," My God.
"
"Monica:"," Are you sure?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh yeah, I'm sure. (Flashback resumes with Phoebe doing a voiceover.) And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. (Flashback continues: Paolo rolls over, Phoebe looks down, then quickly looks up, bites lip, shakes her head)
"
"Monica:"," Was it...?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there.
"
"Rachel:"," ""Ooo,"" what?
"
"Phoebe:"," Uma Thurman.
"
"Monica:"," Oh!
"
"Ross:"," The actress!
"
"Ross:"," Thanks Rach.
"
"Chandler:"," So what are you gonna do?
"
"Ross:"," You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? (waiting for guys to chime in)
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, yeah, you have to tell her.
"
"Joey:"," Feminist issue. That's where I went!
"
"Phoebe:"," She is gonna hate me.
"
"Ross:","(sympathetic yet...) Yeah, well...
"
"Joey:"," Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? (points to a table)
"
"Chandler:"," That's patio furniture!
"
"Joey:"," So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!
"
"Chandler:"," (gesturing towards another table) What about the birds?
"
"Joey:"," I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something.""
"
"Chandler:"," You pick one.
"
"Joey:"," All right, how about the ladybugs?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!
"
"Joey:"," Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!
"
"Chandler:"," Not like that, I won't! (pauses) Kip would have liked the birds! (Joey turns and gives Chandler a dirty look)
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey!
"
"Rachel:"," Hi Pheebs!
"
"Phoebe:"," Are you moving out?
"
"Rachel:"," No, these aren't all my suitcases. (picks up small blue suitcase and shows to Phoebe) This one's Paolo's.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?
"
"Rachel:"," Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh! (sits down) Ok, um, ok, um,
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs...
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, um, (clears throat) we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. (Phoebe opens a tin and offers Rachel a cookie)
"
"Rachel:"," (taking cookie) Ok, thanks Pheebs (takes bite of cookie, overwhelmed) Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies
"
"Rachel:"," All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had.
"
"Phoebe:"," Which proves that I never lie.
"
"Rachel:"," I guess you don't.
"
"Phoebe:"," Paolo made a pass at me.
"
"Chandler:"," So, what do you think?
"
"Ross:"," I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
"
"Chandler:"," I know!
"
"Monica:"," So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?
"
"Joey:"," Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!
"
"Monica:"," Heads up Ross! (Monica scores on Chandler and Joey) Score! (points at Chandler) You suck!
"
"Phoebe:"," Are you okay?
"
"Rachel:"," I need some milk.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, I've got milk (takes thermos from her bag and starts to pour a cup) Here you go... (Rachel drinks straight from thermos) Oh!(Rachel finishes thermos) Better?
"
"Rachel:"," No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!
"
"Phoebe:"," I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!
"
"Rachel:"," Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!
"
"Phoebe:"," No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?
"
"Rachel:"," I don't know...right, he's the pig!
"
"Phoebe:"," Such a pig!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, God, he's such a pig,
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh he's like a...
"
"Rachel:"," He's like a big disgusting...
"
"Phoebe:"," ...like a...
"
"Rachel:"," ...pig...pig man!
"
"Phoebe:"," Yes, good! Ok...
"
"Rachel:"," (voice wavers) Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?
"
"Phoebe:"," (raises hand) Oh! I know! (Rachel startled) It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you...
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, Ok, Pheebs...
"
"Phoebe:"," The end.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, God...
"
"Phoebe:"," Should I not have told you?
"
"Rachel:"," No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better...
"
"Phoebe:"," I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so...
"
"Monica:"," We should get over there and see if she's okay. (switching places with Ross) Just one...second! Score! (Monica scores, high-fives with Ross) Game! Come on. (Monica and Phoebe leave)
"
"Ross:"," (wiping his brow) Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts.
"
"Joey:"," No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team.
"
"Ross:"," Come on, two on one.
"
"Chandler:"," What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!
"
"Ross:"," What, now?
"
"Joey:"," Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!
"
"Chandler:"," My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! (Ross and Chandler look off into the distance. Joey, wondering what they are looking at, looks in the same direction)
"
"Ross:"," (entering) How's it going?
"
"Monica:"," Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, (shows Rachel gesturing with hands in front of her chest), Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, ok bye-bye.
"
"Monica:"," Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, (hands him a lasagna) but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles.
"
"Ross:"," Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... (shuts door in his face and walks away)
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, just look at her... (girls move toward Rachel on the balcony)
"
"Ross:"," Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed...
"
"Monica:"," Oh, you're right.
"
"Ross:"," (pulls Monica back) ...and I really think it should be me.
"
"Ross:"," Hey.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey.
"
"Ross:"," You all right?
"
"Rachel:"," Ooh, I've been better...
"
"Ross:"," Come here. (he hugs Rachel) Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, Ross...
"
"Ross:"," What?
"
"Rachel:"," I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. (Ross crosses arms)
"
"Ross:"," Huh.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh Ross, you're so great!
"
"Ross:"," Ohhhh (Hugs her and sighs)
"
"Monica:"," Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh...
"
"Phoebe:"," You ok?
"
"Rachel:"," ...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yep!
"
"Ross:"," See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process.
"
"Rachel:"," No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want
"
"Ross:"," Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo.
"
"Rachel:"," No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one.
"
"Ross:"," (astonished) What?
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Ross:"," I-I'm, I'm having a boy?
"
"Rachel:"," Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy.
"
"Ross:"," Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy! (babbling) Huh, am I having a boy?
"
"Ross:"," I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!
"
"Chandler:"," Wha-
"
"Joey:"," Wha-
"
"Ross:"," I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
"
"Joey:"," Hey!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey!
"
"Ross:"," I'm having a son. Um...
"
"Monica:"," Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
"
"Monica:"," Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!
"
"Joey:"," Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, get out!
"
"Monica:"," You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! (Joey and Chandler pick her up) All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going, (they throw her out) and I'm gone.
"
"Chandler:"," (to Joey) One more game?
"
"Joey:"," Oh yeah!
"
"Rachel:"," That is it! You just barge in here, you don't knock
"
"Chandler:"," I'm sorry!
"
"Rachel:"," You have no respect for anybody's privacy!
"
"Chandler:"," Rachel, wait, wait.
"
"Rachel:"," No, you wait! This is ridiculous!
"
"Chandler:"," Can I just say one thing?
"
"Rachel:"," What? What?!
"
"Chandler:"," That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh!!
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oops!
"
"Phoebe:"," Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you.
"
"Phoebe:"," Isn't he great?
"
"Rachel:"," He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
"
"Phoebe:"," I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?
"
"Monica:"," So, you think you'll do it on his couch?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl.
"
"Rachel:"," Okaaay. (To the guys, on the couch) Any of you guys want anything else?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, yes, could I have one of those. (Points)
"
"Rachel:"," No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?
"
"Chandler:"," Okay.
"
"Chandler:"," No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies.
"
"Ross:"," You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies?
"
"Chandler:"," It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change.
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies.
"
"Rachel:"," Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice.
"
"Chandler:"," Okaaay, (Gestures) rock, hard place, me.
"
"Chandler:"," Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?
"
"Chandler:"," Huh.
"
"Chandler:"," Uhhuh, how did you know that?
"
"Joey:"," Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?
"
"Monica:"," Hey, how long are you in the city?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, this is my friend Roger.
"
"Joey:"," Dad, dad. (Shakes his head)
"
"Joey:"," (Snatches the phone) Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? (To his dad) Did you know this isn't Ma?
"
"Joey:"," Sure. So how long you been... (Goes back to chopping)
"
"Joey:"," Since then?!
"
"Joey:"," ...I d'know.
"
"Joey:"," You're one to talk. (Puts the mushrooms in a saucepan)
"
"Joey:"," Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
"
"Joey:"," It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. (Considers) That'd be cool.... This blows!
"
"Rachel:"," I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents? (She walks over near Chandler and his gaze stays very obviously on her chest) Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... (Notices Chandler) Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?
"
"Chandler:"," (Without looking up) What? (Looks up) What?
"
"Rachel:"," Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
"
"Ross:"," Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.
"
"Chandler:"," Y'know, I don't see that happening?
"
"Rachel:"," C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.
"
"Chandler:"," Well I'm not showing you my 'tat.'
"
"Monica:"," Hello?
"
"Phoebe:"," (Intercom) It's Phoebe.
"
"Monica:"," C'mon up.
"
"Chandler:"," (Sarcastic) Oh, good. Rog is here.
"
"Joey:"," What's the matter with Rog?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.
"
"Ross:"," What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad.
"
"Ross:"," Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian?
"
"Ross:"," Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why?
"
"Monica:"," Wait-wait, go back to that sibling thing.
"
"Ross:"," That that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
"
"Monica:"," Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
"
"Phoebe:"," Isn't he good?
"
"Ross:"," Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying...
"
"Monica:"," Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!
"
"Ross:"," Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!
"
"Rachel:"," You're right! I mean you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon.
"
"Monica:"," You're welcome.
"
"Monica:"," Hate that guy! (Throws another cookie)
"
"Joey:"," Night, you guys.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh look, it's the woman we ordered.
"
"Joey:"," Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?
"
"Joey:"," I'm Joey Tribbiani.
"
"Chandler:"," Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?
"
"Chandler:"," Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys.
"
"Joey:"," Dad, Ronni's here.
"
"Chandler:"," So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?
"
"Joey:"," Who-ah-ho.
"
"Joey:"," No you won't.
"
"Joey:"," If you go to a hotel you'll be...doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
"
"Joey:"," That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend.
"
"Joey:"," Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room.
"
"Chandler:"," C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by ""No thanks, it's late.""
"
"Joey:"," Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough.
"
"Joey:"," Well, either you break it off with Ronni
"
"Joey:"," Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
"
"Joey:"," I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?
"
"Joey:"," Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, you're gonna.
"
"Joey:"," I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls...
"
"Chandler:"," Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?
"
"Joey:"," Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking...
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?
"
"Joey:"," No.
"
"Chandler:"," No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say ""No thanks, I'm married.""
"
"Joey:"," You really think so?
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah. I really do.
"
"Joey:"," Thanks, Chandler. (Snuggles up to him)
"
"Chandler:"," Get off!
"
"Monica:"," Hi...May I help you?
"
"Monica:"," Okay...who are you?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, c'mon in.
"
"Rachel:"," Hi, I'm Rachel.
"
"Rachel:"," Bathroom's up there.
"
"Rachel:"," Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?
"
"Rachel:"," Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. (She goes into Joey and Chandler's apartment, where Mr. Tribbiani is reading the paper) Hey, Mr. Trib.
"
"Rachel:"," Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
"
"Joey:"," (Runs out in a towel) What's the matter with you?!
"
"Rachel:"," I thought it was Chandler!
"
"Chandler:"," (Comes out of his room) What? What?
"
"Rachel:"," You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
"
"Chandler:"," Sorry, my my thing was in there with me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey.
"
"Monica:"," How's it going?
"
"Phoebe:"," Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
"
"Phoebe:"," So what's going on?
"
"Monica:"," Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger.
"
"Ross:"," I dunno, there's just something about...
"
"Chandler:"," Basically we just feel that he's...
"
"Rachel:"," We hate that guy.
"
"Ross:"," We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry.
"
"Phoebe:"," Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, don't you think, maybe, though, it's just that he's so perceptive that it freaks you out?
"
"Rachel:"," We're sorry.
"
"Joey:"," Ma! What're you doing here?
"
"Joey:"," Oww! Big ring!
"
"Joey:"," Hold on, you-you knew?
"
"Joey:"," So then how could you I mean, how could you?!
"
"Joey:"," Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?
"
"Joey:"," I'm...happy...for you?
"
"Joey:"," Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
"
"Joey:"," With this ring? (Her engagement ring.) No contest.
"
"Phoebe:"," Nothing, nothing.
"
"Phoebe:"," It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't.
"
"Phoebe:"," But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
"
"Phoebe:"," Intense and creepy.
"
"Phoebe:"," But I don't. Me, Phoebe.
"
"Phoebe:"," You're not? See, that's why you're so great!
"
"Monica:"," So you talked to your dad, huh.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today.
"
"Rachel:"," Wow.
"
"Chandler:"," Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
"
"Ross:"," So Joey, you okay?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes.
"
"Rachel:"," Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them.
"
"Chandler:"," If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom.
"
"Phoebe:"," (entering) Hey.
"
"Monica:"," How's it going?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, right.
"
"Rachel:"," What happened?
"
"Phoebe:"," I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey, Joey. What's going on?
"
"Joey:"," Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. (He goes into the bathroom. We hear a scream and he comes out, closely followed by Monica in a towel)
"
"Monica:"," Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
"
"Joey:"," Sorry. Wrong boobies.
"
"Monica:"," Hello, Joey.
"
"Joey:"," I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you.
"
"Ross:"," She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
"
"Chandler:"," Any contact?
"
"Ross:"," She lent me an egg once.
"
"Joey:"," You're in!
"
"Ross:"," Aw, right.
"
"Ross:"," Hey. (stutters something incoherent)
"
"Chandler:"," Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI don't think we need a third...
"
"Joey:"," Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.
"
"Ross:"," An egg?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg.""
"
"Chandler:"," I think it's winning.
"
"Ross:"," I think it's insane.
"
"Chandler:"," She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.
"
"Joey:"," Think it'll work?
"
"Chandler:"," No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg.
"
"Monica:"," You can not do this.
"
"Rachel:"," Do what, do what?
"
"Monica:"," Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
"
"Rachel:"," No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
"
"Phoebe:"," 'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!
"
"Monica:"," But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?
"
"Joey:"," Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, uh, listen, about tonight...
"
"Joey:"," No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...
"
"Joey:"," Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and eats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this.
"
"Ross:"," Hi. She said yes.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug. Something crunches in Ross' shirt pocket.) Still got the egg, huh?
"
"Joey:"," (Looking at himself in the reflection on a knife) How do I look?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, uh, I... don't... care. (Joey's date shows up) Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess.
"
"Chandler:"," ...And what did you bring?
"
"Chandler:"," Janice?
"
"Chandler:"," (angrily) Hey, it's Janice.
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window.
"
"Joey:"," No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down.
"
"Chandler:"," Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!
"
"Joey:"," (at the urinal) Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous.
"
"Chandler:"," I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. (gets up right behind Joey and yells in his ear) Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney.
"
"Monica:"," Which one was Pete Carney?
"
"Rachel:"," Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. (imitating) ""Was it good for you?""
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy. (imitating) ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn't get to win once.
"
"Rachel:"," How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
"
"Monica:"," I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
"
"Phoebe:"," I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
"
"Monica:"," There's more beer, right?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.
"
"Rachel:"," Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect.
"
"Monica:"," Ok, well, what kind of ritual?
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.
"
"Rachel:"," Or?
"
"Phoebe:"," Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.
"
"Monica:"," Burning's good.
"
"Rachel:"," Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.
"
"Joey:"," Good for you. (jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?
"
"Chandler:"," That's OK.
"
"Joey:"," (to Lorraine) We can't do that.
"
"Chandler:"," (disgusted) What? What can't you do?
"
"Joey:"," Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?
"
"Joey:"," Uh, we might be leaving now.
"
"Chandler:"," Tell me it's ""you and me"" we.
"
"Joey:"," She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it.
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, you can not do this to me.
"
"Joey:"," You're right, I'm sorry. You're right.
"
"Joey:"," I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler.
"
"Chandler:"," I hope she throws up on you.
"
"Chandler:"," So...
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, what a crappy night!
"
"Chandler:"," Excuse me. (gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up... other patrons look at him) How ya doin'?
"
"Chandler:"," Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
"
"Chandler:"," You got it. Good woman! (the waiter turns around, it's a man) Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
"
"Chandler:"," That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. (to Janice) I've always wanted to know...
"
"Chandler:"," No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, Chandler, sorry.
"
"Monica:"," Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice.
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, well, this was very special.
"
"Monica:"," Rach, come see who's out here!
"
"Rachel:"," Oh my god. Janice, hi!
"
"Chandler:"," Janice is gonna go away now.
"
"Monica:"," I'll be right back.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, Joey, look who it is.
"
"Joey:"," (in disbelief) Whoa.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, good, Joey's home now.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. (to Chandler) He just happened to call.
"
"Ross:"," I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.
"
"Ross:"," The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend.
"
"Ross:"," If you wanna put a label on it.
"
"Ross:"," Nope, nope, that's it.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. (to Carol and Susan) Helloo!
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine.
"
"Monica:"," All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, that's ok! (throws it in fire) Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man.
"
"Rachel:"," Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place.
"
"Monica:"," Can we just start throwing things in?
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, yeah, ok. (she throws the directions in) Oh, OK.
"
"Rachel:"," (tossing things in the fire) Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah.
"
"Monica:"," Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked.
"
"Rachel:"," (looking at picture) Hey he's wearing a sweater.
"
"Monica:"," No.
"
"Rachel:"," And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
"
"Monica:"," Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure...
"
"Chandler:"," How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
"
"Joey:"," I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush.
"
"Chandler:"," Hi, Just Janice.
"
"Joey:"," (to Chandler) If you don't do it, I will.
"
"Ross:"," So, um, what do you do for a living?
"
"Ross:"," Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad.
"
"Ross:"," Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
"
"Ross:"," Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...(struggling)...does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!
"
"Monica:"," You know, it's a really funny story how this happened.
"
"Rachel:"," Really?
"
"Chandler:"," Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and Jan Forever.
"
"Chandler:"," Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out.
"
"Chandler:"," (surprised) It is?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh no, you see, actually it is.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, no I don't.
"
"Chandler:"," I did, but...
"
"Chandler:"," Call me!
"
"Ross:"," You did so. I swear, I swear(noticing Kristin's absence) How long has she been in the bathroom?
"
"Ross:"," Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
"
"Ross:"," Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still pretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off and eats it.)
"
"Ross:"," No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you.
"
"Ross:"," No but, no but.
"
"Ross:"," That's easy for you to say, you found one already.
"
"Rachel:"," So, um, will you bring the truck?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, my god.
"
"Phoebe:"," See, there you go, the cleansing works!
"
"Monica:"," They're nice guys.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, they're firemen guys.
"
"Rachel:"," (to Joey) Coffee. (Hands it to him.)
"
"Joey:"," Thank you.
"
"Rachel:"," (to Ross) Cappuccino. (Hands it to him.)
"
"Ross:"," Grazie.
"
"Rachel:"," And a nice hot cider for Monica. (Hands it to her.)
"
"Monica:"," Aww, thank you. (Notices something.) Uh Rach?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah?
"
"Monica:"," Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh! That's why. (Rachel checks behind her ear, and finds a cinamon stick.) I'm sorry!
"
"Chandler:"," Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. (Chandler tries to hide a rubber chicken from the woman.) Nothing.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know...
"
"Chandler:"," Hey!
"
"Phoebe:"," Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
"
"Ross:"," What's going on?
"
"Chandler:"," So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor.
"
"Chandler:"," So.... I quit.
"
"Chandler:"," Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years.
"
"Chandler:"," If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do.
"
"Phoebe:"," So was it a lot more money?
"
"Chandler:"," It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
"
"Rachel:"," ... the WENUS?
"
"Chandler:"," Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
"
"Rachel:"," (sarcastic) Oh. That WENUS.
"
"Joey:"," So what're you going to do?
"
"Chandler:"," I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? (pause) Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef.
"
"Monica:"," (taps Phoebe on her shoulder) Um... hi there.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hi! (turns back to Chandler, then to Monica) Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so....
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
"
"Phoebe:"," (to Monica's tapping) Yeah, yeah!
"
"Monica:"," Well, what kind of food is he looking for?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu.
"
"Monica:"," (excited) Oh my God!
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, I know! (turns to Chandler) So, what do you think?
"
"Chandler:"," Thanks, Phoebe. But I just don't really see myself in a big white hat.
"
"Phoebe:"," OK. (pause) Oh Monica! Guess what!
"
"Chandler:"," Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
"
"Rachel:"," No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.
"
"Phoebe:"," Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. (pause) I added the ""a-gogo.""
"
"Rachel:"," Career counselor?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, you guys all know what you want to do.
"
"Rachel:"," I don't!
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream.
"
"Ross:"," Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, I love my life, I love my life!
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! Brian's Song!
"
"Rachel:"," The meeting with the guy went great?
"
"Monica:"," So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right.
"
"Chandler:"," Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
"
"Monica:"," So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises.
"
"Rachel:"," What are you going to make?
"
"Phoebe:"," (as though Rachel wasn't paying attention) Yummy noises.
"
"Rachel:"," (pause) And Monica, what are you going to make?
"
"Monica:"," I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! I know what you could make! (runs over to join Monica and Rachel in the kitchen) I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? (Monica doesn't know.) You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. (sits down)
"
"Ross:"," Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?
"
"Joey:"," How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free.
"
"Ross:"," OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?
"
"Chandler:"," Who are you going out with?
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, is this the bug lady?
"
"Rachel:"," (trying to sound like a bug) Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross.
"
"Ross:"," Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
"
"Rachel:"," So what are you guys going to do?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I'd introduce her to my monkey.
"
"Chandler:"," And he's not speaking metaphorically.
"
"Joey:"," (aside to Ross) So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe... (gestures with hands, back and forth) huh-huh?
"
"Ross:"," Well, I don't know.... (gestures) huh-huh.... but I'm hoping (gestures) huh-huh.
"
"Joey:"," I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal.
"
"Ross:"," Celia, don't worry!  Don't scream!  He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel...
"
"Ross:"," Alright... (lifts Marcel away)
"
"Monica:"," (to Joey) OK, try this salmon mousse.
"
"Joey:"," (tasting) Mmmm. Good.
"
"Monica:"," Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
"
"Joey:"," It's creamier.
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, well, is that better?
"
"Joey:"," I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?
"
"Rachel:"," My God! What happened to you?
"
"Chandler:"," Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? (he taps the results and reads them) ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation.""
"
"Phoebe:"," That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
"
"Chandler:"," Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something...something.
"
"Rachel:"," (comes up and rubs him on the chest) Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!
"
"Monica:"," (brings a plate of tiny appetizers over) Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up.
"
"Chandler:"," Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you.
"
"Monica:"," It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
"
"Chandler:"," (tastes it) Well.... it is amouz-ing...
"
"Monica:"," (on phone) Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Wendy! (Listens) Yeah, eight o'clock. (Listens) What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... (Listens) OK, great. (Listens) All right, I'll see you then. Bye. (hangs up)
"
"Phoebe:"," Ten dollars an hour for what?
"
"Monica:"," Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out.
"
"Rachel:"," (hurt) Waitressing?
"
"Joey:"," Uh-oh.
"
"Monica:"," Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
"
"Rachel:"," But, but?
"
"Monica:"," But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
"
"Chandler:"," You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76. (dead silence) Amouz-bouche? (holds out tray)
"
"Ross:"," OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning...
"
"Ross:"," (embarrassed) Wha... what, here?
"
"Ross:"," Ah....
"
"Ross:"," (panicked) Er.... um.....
"
"Ross:"," Um... uh.... vulva.
"
"Joey:"," (in disbelief) Vulva?
"
"Ross:"," Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling.
"
"Joey:"," (sarcastic) Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
"
"Ross:"," Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?
"
"Joey:"," What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
"
"Ross:"," (deadpan) Please be kidding.
"
"Joey:"," Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
"
"Ross:"," OK. (closes eyes) I'm in my apartment...
"
"Joey:"," ....yeah... what else?
"
"Ross:"," That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. (gets up, walks across room)
"
"Joey:"," (walks to catch up to him) Alright, look, I'll start, OK?
"
"Ross:"," Joey, please.
"
"Joey:"," Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! (in a low voice) Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now.
"
"Ross:"," (impressed) Wow.
"
"Joey:"," Alright, now you say something.
"
"Ross:"," I... ahem... I really don't think so.
"
"Joey:"," Come on! You like this woman, right?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah.
"
"Joey:"," You want to see her again, right?
"
"Ross:"," Sure.
"
"Joey:"," Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!
"
"Ross:"," OK, turn around. (Joey looks taken aback) I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this.
"
"Joey:"," (turning around) Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead.
"
"Ross:"," Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips.
"
"Joey:"," There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
"
"Ross:"," I, er...
"
"Ross:"," I want to take my tongue... and...
"
"Ross:"," ....and....
"
"Joey:"," Say it... say it!
"
"Ross:"," ...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
"
"Chandler:"," (smiling)....with??
"
"Ross:"," (rushing to explain) Funny story!
"
"Joey:"," You're not going to believe this!
"
"Chandler:"," It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
"
"Joey:"," Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again.
"
"Chandler:"," Again?
"
"Joey:"," And again, and again, and again... (phone rings, he answers) Hello? (hands phone to Chandler) And again.
"
"Chandler:"," (on phone) Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? (Listens) Yeah, I miss you too. (Listens) Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? (Listens) Well, that's very generous (Listens) er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... (Listens) And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? (Listens) Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! (Listens) No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! (Listens) I'll see you on Monday! (slams the phone down)
"
"Chandler:"," Well?
"
"Phoebe:"," (excited) Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube.
"
"Chandler:"," Look at this! (he opens the curtain to a view of New York City)
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh! You have a window!
"
"Chandler:"," Yes indeedy! (they look outside) With a beautiful view of...
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh look! That guy's peeing!
"
"Chandler:"," (walks away from window) OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down.
"
"Phoebe:"," (sitting) OK.
"
"Chandler:"," This is great! (he presses a button on his intercom) Helen, could you come in here for a moment?
"
"Chandler:"," Thank you Helen, that'll be all.
"
"Chandler:"," Last time I do that, I promise.
"
"Monica:"," (shouting on phone) Wendy, we had a deal! (Listens) Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! (hangs up)
"
"Rachel:"," Who was that?
"
"Monica:"," Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. (she walks away towards the door)
"
"Monica:"," Ten dollars an hour.
"
"Rachel:"," No.
"
"Monica:"," Twelve dollars an hour.
"
"Rachel:"," Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around.
"
"Monica:"," You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... (Rachel isn't buying it, desperate) twenty dollars an hour.
"
"Rachel:"," Done.
"
"Rachel:"," Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
"
"Monica:"," Hi Steve!
"
"Monica:"," (to Steve) This is Rachel.
"
"Phoebe:"," (overemphasizing) Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of (Monica signals her to stop) of, OK, smells.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?
"
"Rachel:"," What's up?
"
"Phoebe:"," (whispers) In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie.
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Phoebe:"," Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?
"
"Rachel:"," OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK.
"
"Rachel:"," Let me, let me get you some wine!
"
"Monica:"," Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. (Steve sits, Monica brings over a tray) OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... (Steve starts to eat them one by one, quickly)... with just a touch of mints... and... (he finishes)... ginger.
"
"Monica:"," I'm so glad you liked them!
"
"Monica:"," Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets.
"
"Rachel:"," Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
"
"Monica:"," (joining him and taking the taco shells) You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
"
"Monica:"," You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes...
"
"Monica:"," No, we don't. (reaches for box)
"
"Monica:"," Why don't you just have a seat here? (he sits at the table, then tries to secretly eat the Gummi-bears. Monica spots him.) OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
"
"Monica:"," Give them to me.
"
"Monica:"," No, give me the...
"
"Monica:"," (furious) That's it! Dinner is over!
"
"Monica:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?
"
"Joey:"," What a tool!
"
"Rachel:"," You don't want to work for a guy like that.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah!
"
"Monica:"," I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it.
"
"Ross:"," Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
"
"Joey:"," (to Ross) So, er... how did it go with Celia?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, I was unbelievable.
"
"Joey:"," All right, Ross!
"
"Ross:"," I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers.
"
"Joey:"," Whoa! And the... (gestures with hands) huh-huh?
"
"Ross:"," Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh...
"
"Joey:"," You cuddled.
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, which was nice.
"
"Phoebe:"," You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
"
"Rachel:"," Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, where the hell is he?
"
"Chandler:"," (on phone) Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... (Listens) Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! (slams phone down, then leans back and realizes what just happened) Whooooaaaa....
"
"Phoebe:"," How's this? (presses down hard)
"
"Phoebe:"," Sorry. How about over here? (presses down hard again)
"
"Phoebe:"," See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? (presses down elsewhere)
"
"Phoebe:"," What about this? (she starts using her elbows on his back, he yells in pain)
"
"Phoebe:"," There you go! (She continues to work him over with her elbows and he continues to yell in pain.)
"
"Chandler:"," This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now.
"
"Joey:"," Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?
"
"Chandler:"," Its Phoebe! Hi!
"
"Chandler:"," Wait, wait! Wh-what are you doing here?
"
"Joey:"," No, no... how come you are working here?
"
"Chandler:"," Can we start over?
"
"Ross:"," I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, ""supposedly"" by accident.
"
"Rachel:"," No, yeah, Ive done that.
"
"Ross:"," And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword.
"
"Rachel:"," Ive never done that.
"
"Chandler:"," All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister.
"
"Joey:"," Im sayin I see a difference.
"
"Chandler:"," Theyre twins!
"
"Joey:"," I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!
"
"Chandler:"," You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things?
"
"Joey:"," Yeah.
"
"Chandler:"," Lets not do that any more.
"
"Joey:"," Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, ooh, fun! Okay... um, Liam Neeson.
"
"Joey:"," Nope.
"
"Phoebe:"," Morly Safer.
"
"Joey:"," Nope.
"
"Phoebe:"," The woman who cuts my hair!
"
"Monica:"," Okay, look, this could be a really long game.
"
"Chandler:"," Your sister Ursula.
"
"Phoebe:"," (Her face dropping) Oh, really.
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh...
"
"Phoebe:"," Rifts. Yeah, I know.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, you do? Because she said you guys havent talked in like years.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hmmm? Yeah. So, um, is she fat?
"
"Joey:"," Not from where I was standin.
"
"Phoebe:"," (Turning to Chandler) where were you standing?
"
"Rachel:"," Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just dont get along?
"
"Phoebe:"," Its mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it... later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new?""
"
"Ross:"," Oh, Pheebs, Im sorry, Ive got to go. Ive got Lamaze class.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, and Ive got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in Gym.
"
"Rachel:"," So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?
"
"Ross:"," No, Susans gonna be there too. Weve got dads, weve got lesbians, the whole parenting team.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, isnt, isnt that gonna be weird?
"
"Ross:"," No, no. (Distractedly putting on a jacket to go out) I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think Im pretty comfortable with the whole situation.
"
"Monica:"," Ross, thats my jacket.
"
"Ross:"," I know.
"
"Ross:"," Hi, um, Im err, (has to clear his throat) Im Ross Geller, and err ah... (pats Carols bulge) ..thats, thats my boy in there, and uh, (points) this is Carol Willick, and this... is Susan Bunch. Susan is um Carols, just, com... (embarrassment finally overwhelms the poor fellow, who becomes incoherent until) ..whos next?
"
"Ross:"," Susan is Carols, Carols, Carols, friend...
"
"Ross:"," Like buddies.
"
"Ross:"," You know how close women can get.
"
"Ross:"," Although I was married to her.
"
"Ross:"," Err, right.
"
"Ross:"," A little.
"
"Ross:"," Absolutely. (Turns back to the woman next to him.) So, twins... hah! Thats like two births. (He struggles again.) Ouch.
"
"Chandler:"," And (he imitates the buzzer) to you too, Helen.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, okay. Send her in.
"
"Chandler:"," Hi, Nina. Come on in.
"
"Chandler:"," Uh, Yes. Yes. Ive just been going over your data here, and little thing, youve been post-dating your Friday numbers.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack.
"
"Chandler:"," WENUS. (Coughs) Weekly Estimated Net...
"
"Chandler:"," Its not just that shes cute, okay. Its just that... shes really really cute.
"
"Ross:"," It doesnt matter. You dont dip your pen in the company ink.
"
"Monica:"," Ross, your little creatures got the remote again.
"
"Ross:"," Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now... Marce... you give Rossie the remote...
"
"Monica:"," Great.
"
"Ross:"," Relax, Ill fix it.
"
"Rachel:"," (Looking at the television) Cool... ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel.""
"
"Ross:"," (looking at the remote) How did he do this?
"
"Chandler:"," (Looking out at the balcony) So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?
"
"Monica:"," Ah no, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Years... but obviously someone forgot.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, someone was supposed to write ""Rach, take down the lights"" and put it on the re... frigerate... (finally noticing Monicas note stuck to the refrigerator) How long has that been there?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, where you been?
"
"Joey:"," I went back to Riffs. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, she brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries.
"
"Chandler:"," Score.
"
"Joey:"," She is so hot!
"
"Chandler:"," Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by err... (he indicates Phoebe, who is helping Ross understand the remote control.)
"
"Joey:"," Pheebs?
"
"Phoebe:"," (Jumping up) Yeah?
"
"Joey:"," You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister?
"
"Phoebe:"," Why? Why would you wanna... do that?  Why?
"
"Joey:"," So that if we went out on a date, shed be there.
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, I mean, Im not my sisters, you know, whatever, and um... I mean, its true, we were one egg, once, but err, you know, weve grown apart, so, um... I dont know, why not? Okay.
"
"Joey:"," Cool, thanks.
"
"Ross:"," You okay?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah Im fine.
"
"Ross:"," You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
"
"Ross:"," Sorry.
"
"Ross:"," Hi. Sorry Im late. Wheres, wheres Carol?
"
"Ross:"," No... No... No. I think I should stay, I think we should both know whats going on.
"
"Ross:"," Okay, Im gonna play my sperm card one more time.
"
"Ross:"," I see. So what do you propose to do?
"
"Ross:"," Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads!
"
"Chandler:"," Mr. D, hows it going, sir?
"
"Chandler:"," And?
"
"Chandler:"," So what does this mean?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very &ndash;
"
"Chandler:"," Nina? Nina. (He goes around his desk to where she is sitting.) Nina. (In pain) Nina.
"
"Chandler:"," (Looking down at her hand) Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me.
"
"Chandler:"," (Suddenly bright) Would you like to have dinner sometime?
"
"Rachel:"," So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn?
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
"
"Rachel:"," Ooh, okay... good.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah?
"
"Phoebe:"," (Smiling blankly) Right, and its me.
"
"Phoebe:"," Much as you are.
"
"Phoebe:"," (Philosophically) Oh, thats good.
"
"Phoebe:"," Good choice.
"
"Monica:"," I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights.
"
"Monica:"," Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument.
"
"Chandler:"," Im just trying to find the right moment, you know?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. (Imitating men at their worst) ""Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work?""
"
"Joey:"," Hey.
"
"Chandler:"," You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more.
"
"Monica:"," Ill get it.
"
"Monica:"," Oh. Hi, Mr.Heckles.
"
"Monica:"," Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly.
"
"Rachel:"," You dont even have cats.
"
"Monica:"," (Closing the door) Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
"
"Rachel:"," Well try to keep it down.
"
"Joey:"," Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ooh, my first birthday present... (delightedly examining the cardigan in her lap) ..oh, this is really...
"
"Joey:"," Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size-wise.
"
"Phoebe:"," Ohhh... Sure, yeah... (disgustedly dropping the cardigan back into the bag) ..okay, it fits.
"
"Rachel:"," Are you seein her again tonight?
"
"Joey:"," Yep. Ice Capades.
"
"Chandler:"," Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade.
"
"Joey:"," I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about her.
"
"Phoebe:"," That you like, (snappily confronting Joey over the heads of the knitting circle) we get it. You like her. Great!
"
"Joey:"," Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Alright, well, maybe now its not okay.
"
"Joey:"," Okay... Well maybe now Im not okay with it not being okay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay.
"
"Chandler:"," Knit, good woman, knit, knit!
"
"Chandler:"," And thats the Chrysler Building right there.
"
"Chandler:"," Yes, yes she is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, err, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen-nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan.
"
"Chandler:"," And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, he uh, mentioned the word frenzy.
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, no, no. Nina... (miming fairies twinkling around his head) ..she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all.
"
"Chandler:"," And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others.
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir.
"
"Ross:"," Susan, go deep.
"
"Ross:"," Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gonna be alright.
"
"Ross:"," Im gonna be a father.
"
"Rachel:"," This is just occurring to you?
"
"Ross:"," I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me.
"
"Rachel:"," (She comforts him too) Oh, youre gonna be great!
"
"Ross:"," Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?
"
"Chandler:"," You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different.
"
"Phoebe:"," Wherere you going?
"
"Joey:"," Out.
"
"Phoebe:"," With?
"
"Joey:"," (Spreading his arms wide) Yes.
"
"Phoebe:"," Alright, could I just ask you one question?
"
"Phoebe:"," Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet?
"
"Joey:"," Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay?
"
"Joey:"," You meant sex, right?
"
"Chandler:"," Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us.
"
"Chandler:"," Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise.
"
"Chandler:"," Sure, why not?
"
"Chandler:"," Oh, you dont know. (Presses a button.) Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise?
"
"Chandler:"," Helen drinks. (Insincerely) Will you marry me?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, I ended up telling her everything.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, howd she take it?
"
"Chandler:"," Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. (He holds up a bandaged hand.) Little tip: if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand... (he mimes Nina taking her revenge) ..on the desk.
"
"Monica:"," Okay, I think I get how to do this.
"
"Phoebe:"," Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch.
"
"Monica:"," (Remotely turning off the television) okay, Pheebs, theyre gone.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay.
"
"Monica:"," Are you alright?
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its...
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?
"
"Phoebe:"," Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wanna be around... anything that looked like either one of us.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh... Oh, Pheebs.
"
"Phoebe:"," I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but...
"
"Chandler:"," Youre not gonna lose him.
"
"Monica:"," Hon, you gotta talk to Joey.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah. Okay.
"
"Ross:"," No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt.
"
"Phoebe:"," But hes falling in love with her.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious.
"
"Phoebe:"," Okay... Okay.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, okay, oh.
"
"Monica:"," Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside?
"
"Rachel:"," No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so... (she climbs onto the railing to reach the top of a pole) ..Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa! (Screams.)
"
"Monica:"," Oh-my-god Rachel! (Rushing out to look over the edge) Rachel!
"
"Rachel:"," (To Monica) Im okay! Im okay! (She knocks on Mr. Heckles's window.) Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?
"
"Rachel:"," Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.
"
"Monica:"," Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or or ankle or something.
"
"Rachel:"," Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
"
"Monica:"," Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call?
"
"Rachel:"," You.
"
"Monica:"," Really?
"
"Rachel:"," Yeah.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, that is so sweet. (Touched, she puts an arm around her friend and kisses her.) Oh gosh, love you. Insurance?
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that.
"
"Monica:"," (No longer touched) you don't have insurance?
"
"Rachel:"," Why, how much is this gonna cost?
"
"Monica:"," I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars.
"
"Rachel:"," Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do?
"
"Monica:"," Well there's not much we can do.
"
"Rachel:"," (Like a big baby) Um... unless, unless I use yours.
"
"Monica:"," Hah, no no no no no no no no no no.
"
"Rachel:"," (Tapping the clipboard) well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" person?
"
"Monica:"," (Looking around to check that no-one's listening, then lowering her voice anyway) That's insurance fraud.
"
"Rachel:"," Well, alright, then, forget it. (Getting up to go) Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow!
"
"Monica:"," (Jumping up to make Rachel sit down) Okay, okay. I hate this.
"
"Rachel:"," Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
"
"Monica:"," (to the nurse) Hi, (tiny laugh) um, I'm gonna need a new set of (tiny laugh) these forms (tiny laugh).
"
"Monica:"," (Tiny laugh) I am really an idiot. (Tiny laugh) you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting her information, (tiny laugh) I put mine.
"
"Monica:"," (Tiny laugh) yep, that's me, (tiny laugh) I am that stupid (tiny laugh).
"
"Ross:"," I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
"
"Ross:"," No, no, with him. (He mimes holding the baby like a football.) I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me.
"
"Joey:"," Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
"
"Ross:"," Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah-hah, I just heave it down field.
"
"Chandler:"," What are you crazy? That's a baby!
"
"Joey:"," He should take the sack?
"
"Ross:"," Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father.
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad.
"
"Joey:"," Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?
"
"Chandler:"," Well, only if you order stuff.
"
"Joey:"," I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
"
"Ross:"," Wo-wo-whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
"
"Joey:"," When's that?
"
"Ross:"," Tonight.
"
"Joey:"," Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?
"
"Ross:"," You take your time.
"
"Chandler:"," There it is! So what're you gonna do?
"
"Joey:"," What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula.
"
"Chandler:"," And your friend Phoebe?
"
"Joey:"," Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?
"
"Chandler:"," Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit.
"
"Monica:"," Yes? (jumping as Rachel punches her arm) ..yes, she is.
"
"Rachel:"," Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
"
"Rachel:"," I meant er, (struggling to concentrate) young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach.
"
"Rachel:"," ..so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it.
"
"Monica:"," Uh, you left out the stupid part.
"
"Rachel:"," Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said ""yes.""
"
"Monica:"," I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates.
"
"Rachel:"," What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, (spelling it out in the air for her slow friend) cute doctors, doctors who are cute!
"
"Chandler:"," Alright, what have we learned so far?
"
"Ross:"," What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
"
"Rachel:"," Was that the cake?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush.
"
"Monica:"," Come on, she'll be here any minute.
"
"Rachel:"," I hope it's okay.
"
"Monica:"," Oh...
"
"Chandler:"," (Reading) ""Happy Birthday Peehe.""
"
"Monica:"," Well maybe we can make a, a, a 'B' out of one of those roses.
"
"Ross:"," (Still annoyed) Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey, what's going on?
"
"Ross:"," Oh, we just...
"
"Phoebe:"," (Delighted) oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! (Thrilled) You found Betty! Oh my god! (Hugging people) This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, (still happy) Where's Joey?
"
"Chandler:"," Did you see Betty?
"
"Ross:"," Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?
"
"Ross:"," Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?
"
"Ross:"," No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.
"
"Ross:"," Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father?
"
"Ross:"," No, we can go to Williamsburg.
"
"Monica:"," Rachel, the cute doctors are here.
"
"Rachel:"," (entering from her room) Okay, coming!
"
"Monica:"," Hi, come on in.
"
"Monica:"," Hi, Geoffrey.
"
"Rachel:"," Hi.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, that's great. Look at that.
"
"Monica:"," It's uh...
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine.
"
"Monica:"," It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss?
"
"Monica:"," A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay?
"
"Monica:"," I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby.
"
"Rachel:"," (Resenting the truth) I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we...
"
"Monica:"," Sure, every time, you're such a princess...
"
"Rachel:"," You know what?
"
"Monica:"," What?
"
"Rachel:"," You know what?
"
"Monica:"," What!?
"
"Rachel:"," You know what?
"
"Monica:"," (getting angry) What!!?
"
"Rachel:"," Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother.
"
"Rachel:"," Hello! Here we go!
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago.
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Yeah... (joining the others) ..see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar.
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. (Indicating a dish on the table) Why don't you try the hummus?
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown.
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do.
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) (Suddenly laughing) Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it!
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow?
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) I used to wet my bed.
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) (Revealing her anger to point at her best friend) We both do that!
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. (Getting up to move further away from Rachel) li-listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you...
"
"Rachel:"," Would you excuse me for a second?
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Remember back in freshman year? (Talking fast before Rachel can catch her) Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed.
"
"Rachel:"," (on phone) Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business! (Rachel turns to Monica, clasping the receiver to her bosom so Dr.Green can't hear, while mouthing ""You are..."") ...dead!
"
"Monica:"," Ross, he's got the remote again.
"
"Ross:"," Good. Maybe he can switch it back.
"
"Ross:"," Maybe not.
"
"Rachel:"," Hello? (Listens) Um, yeah, uh, (snapping her fingers at Ross who takes the remote from Marcel, then turns off the TV) Okay ah, hold on a second, lemme lemme just check and see if see if she's here.
"
"Rachel:"," It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. She says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god...
"
"Monica:"," I don't know! Why don't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!
"
"Rachel:"," Okay (desperately hands the receiver over) no, you do it.
"
"Monica:"," (taking the phone) Hello, this is Monica... Yeah??? Oh... (Smiles at Rachel to reassure her) Okay, yes, we'll be right, we'll be right down.(Listens) Thank you. (Hangs up)
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
"
"Rachel:"," Ohhh... (slumping in relief) Okay, you were right. You were right! This was just not worth it.
"
"Monica:"," Thank you.
"
"Rachel:"," Okay, let me just change.
"
"Monica:"," Yes.
"
"Joey:"," (entering quietly) Hey.
"
"Monica:"," Hi.
"
"Phoebe:"," Trouble?
"
"Joey:"," Your sister stood me up the other night.
"
"Phoebe:"," Oh, no. Don't you hate it when people aren't there for you?
"
"Ross:"," Well did you try calling her?
"
"Joey:"," I've been trying for two days. When I called the restaurant, they said she was too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off.
"
"Phoebe:"," Hey.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um you, you got a minute?
"
"Phoebe:"," So.
"
"Phoebe:"," Um, oh, I got you a birthday present.
"
"Phoebe:"," Right, like the kind you...
"
"Phoebe:"," How'd you know I was coming?
"
"Phoebe:"," I can't believe you did this.
"
"Phoebe:"," I can't believe you... (holding up Joey's cardigan) ..did this.
"
"Phoebe:"," So... What's the deal with umm, you and Joey?
"
"Phoebe:"," Does he know?
"
"Phoebe:"," Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you.
"
"Phoebe:"," You got me.
"
"Phoebe:"," So, um, are you gonna call him?
"
"Phoebe:"," No, Joey.
"
"Phoebe:"," No. No food with a face.
"
"Phoebe:"," Yeah, you too.
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Hi, remember us?
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Um, okay. You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on the admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one (little laugh) because uh, you see, I-I, I put the wrong name again. (Little laugh) 'cause um...
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) I am. I'm that stupid. (Little laugh.)
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Yeah, and and, I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Yeah, I know... (mirroring her friend) ..I'm I'm just not that bright either.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father.
"
"Ross:"," Uh-huh.
"
"Chandler:"," Say your son never feels connected to you, as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this.
"
"Ross:"," Do you have a point?
"
"Chandler:"," You know, you think I would.
"
"Chandler:"," What's up with the simian?
"
"Ross:"," It's just a fur ball.
"
"Chandler:"," Okay... (returning to the board) ..whose turn is it?
"
"Ross:"," Yours, I just got 43 points for 'KIDNEY'.
"
"Chandler:"," No, no, you got zero points for 'IDNEY'.
"
"Ross:"," I had a 'K'. Where's where's my 'K'?
"
"Ross:"," You've got to help me my monkey swallowed a 'K'!
"
"Ross:"," No, no you don't understand the animal hospital is way across town he's choking I don't know what else to do.
"
"Monica:"," What's goin' on?
"
"Chandler:"," Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
"
"Rachel:"," Oh.
"
"Ross:"," Lady, he is people. He has a name, okay? He watches Jeopardy! He he touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please have a heart!
"
"Monica:"," Michael.
"
"Rachel:"," What?
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Monica.
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Oh.
"
"Monica:"," (as Rachel) Hi.
"
"Rachel:"," (as Monica) Hi.
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) Hey.
"
"Joey:"," Urse...
"
"Joey:"," ..ah, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you.
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) Listen, um...
"
"Joey:"," No, no, no, don't say ""listen."" I know that ""listen."" I've said that ""listen.""
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) I'm sorry.
"
"Joey:"," I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula): Yeah, um... (nervously clears her throat) You know you, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk!
"
"Joey:"," You don't drink.
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) That's right, I don't... But I was, I was drunk on you!
"
"Joey:"," Oh, Urse... (He tries to take her in his arms, but she fends him off.)
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) Okay, yeah, so it's not gonna work.
"
"Joey:"," Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?
"
"Joey:"," (Thinking carefully) no. No, I, I couldn't do that.
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) Um, then yes, it's 'cause of Phoebe! So, you know, it's either her or me.
"
"Joey:"," Then, uh, then I'm sorry.
"
"Phoebe:"," (as Ursula) You know... (unconsciously putting a hand on his knee) You're gonna be really, really hard to get over.
"
"Joey:"," I know...
"
"Joey:"," I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or... what, but you have never looked so beautiful.
"
"Phoebe:"," Really?
"
"Joey:"," Pheebs?
"
"Phoebe:"," (Automatically) Yeah. Oooh... (she's sprung.)
"
"Ross:"," He looks so tiny.
"
"Joey:"," We just got the message.
"
"Phoebe:"," Is he alright?
"
"Ross:"," Yeah. The doctor got the 'K' out. He also found an 'M' and an 'O'.
"
"Chandler:"," We think he was trying to spell out 'MONKEY.'
"
"Ross:"," Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine, he's just sleeping now.
"
"Chandler:"," (Tapping Ross on his shoulder) So, you feel like a dad yet?
"
"Ross:"," No, why?
"
"Chandler:"," Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad.
"
"Monica:"," Oh, look, he's waking up!
"
"Ross:"," (Quietly) hey, fella! How you doing?
"
